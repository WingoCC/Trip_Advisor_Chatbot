      "This church is very solemn. He does not have a particularly dazzling appearance, nor is it built to be particularly tall. He leaves the largest space for the hall. There are also very many people inside. There are many locals.",
      "This old church has always been very prestigious in the local area. When I went there that day, I didn\u2019t know if it was in time for a festival. The church was crowded with people inside and out. It seemed to be under maintenance. It was magnificent.",
      "This is a church with a strong sense of history. There were many tourists who came to visit, but he himself came to this church to pray for a lot of people. He said that this church was left by the colonists at that time.",
      "This church can be regarded as a local religious center, but when I went there, I didn't see many people in the afternoon. The size of the entire church is medium. There are statues of Catherine and Mary inside."
