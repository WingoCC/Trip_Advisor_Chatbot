I recommend to go there early in the morning at 8 am, to have time to enjoy that beauty without crowds of tourists. they arrive there at around 8:30. No need to pay additional fee, your ticket for Angkor complex is active there. If you have one more day in Siem Reap - visit this place and you will not regret:)",

          "transportation As it's been mentioned by other travellers, it's quite easy to get there by bus from Fenghuang city or Tongren (the Wall is between the cities). But it won't be so easy to get back from the Wall as it was in my case I've visited this \"Great Wall\" in the last day of my Tongren journey. So after this place I was thinking this would be easy to get to the airport. So naive I was. No buses, no taxi drivers around. I walked to the highway and wanted to hail one of the passing by cars. Spent around 40 minutes on the road side without any result. Locals didn't even know there was an airport in Tongren, they thought if its name is Fenghuang (Eng. Phoenix) airport then it should be nearby the Fenghuang city, which in the opposite direction from where it actually was. So I gave up asking local people on how to get out of that place, just started hailing the cars. Finally I got a family who wanted to help, but they also didn't know they had an airport in their city. They gave me a lift, though they used an online navigator to get to the right place. So be prepared for this kind of things when you're going to that Wall. P.S. it is not so spectacular as an original Great Wall of China. It will take up to 20-30 minutes to explore all the available surroundings. It will cost you 40 RMB and a lot of stress on how to find a way back to the city.",

The number of people wearing Miao costumes standing on the jumping rock and taking pictures is the most. There are renting clothes on both sides.

It is within walking distance of the ancient city. There is a parking lot next to Hongqiao, where you can take a battery car for 1 yuan. It is the most convenient means of transportation in and out of the ancient city.\n\nIt is most recommended to go to the bridge to see the night scene at night. There are many stilts around. The two banks of the Tuojiang River are picturesque and the view is very good. There are many tourists here after 11pm. On both sides of the first floor of Hongqiao are basically small stalls selling tourist goods. I don\u2019t feel that there is anything particularly eye-catching, and the price is also expensive. There are many special products in the ancient city of Phoenix. There are three best currencies to buy Miao silver jewelry, especially not too expensive of. The Biancheng International Youth Hostel where we live is on Hongqiao Middle Road, a 5-minute walk from Hongqiao. The upper part of the Hongqiao Bridge is not big, but it is a great location to photograph the ancient city of Phoenix and Tuojiang.

It has never disappointed here. Visitors only learn about the history of the Utah State Capitol through the murals and sculptures that surround the building, including the ceiling and dome. If you are lucky enough to be in the town during the six weeks of the Legislative Council meeting, that is, from January 25, 2016 to March 10, 2016, you should go to the Council to observe. If you are a photographer, you must take a lot of pictures of marble halls, rooms, paintings, and take pictures of the scenery overlooking the entire Salt Lake Valley from east to south.",

We told the Japanese-speaking missionary to plan a 15-minute sightseeing tour for our atheist students. We walked to the auditorium, the shrine, and then to the visitor center to the north, where we saw the statue of Jesus Christ and listened to the narration in Japanese. He was quiet at first, but ended up asking a lot of questions about God and Mormon temples. We ended up staying for almost 3 hours.

If you don\u2019t give it, let\u2019s fill out an \u201cinterview form\u201d and rely on me to travel and interview, so I\u2019ll die. She said that her handling fee was not clearly marked, and she said, \"I ask you to fill it out! I ask you to fill it out!\" That face was as black as her dead. No visa if you don't give money! Another thing that pitted this person was that the rented car was parked illegally on the red and white lines, and the tires of the car were locked. The traffic police came and asked him for 1,000 baht, and then said he would give him 500 baht to do it, and then let it go. It felt like trying to pit the Chinese. , I gave him the money, but I didn\u2019t have any proof. I don\u2019t know if there were any moths when changing cars! Before I came, many people told me that the people in the Buddhist country of Thailand are simple and kind. Hehe, no longer come to Thailand in this life. The prices are ridiculously high, 60 baht per kilogram of cabbage, 7.5 per kilogram of cabbage, no one buys 0.99 cabbage in my family. . . For 40 baht a kilo of oranges, 5 yuan a catty, haha 3 yuan for my family. 40 baht a piece of ice cream, 10 yuan, my family's three yuan ice cream is very delicious. Alas, Thailand has already reached this point, and the Chinese should not come to help the poor. China is the poorest one.",
          "If you want to massage, you have to make an appointment. Every day, the appointments are full. You must abide by the rules and regulations inside. The consumption is a bit mandatory. You need to take a taxi to get in. It is not allowed to take pictures indoors. The technique is traditional Thai massage, which is not expensive at all. , The service is good, the water is still very diligent, you can choose the length of the massage, the supporting facilities are good, and you can have a meal after you press it, which is very convenient.",
          "Chiang Mai\u2019s massage is a must go, the general shop is as you enter and press ~ 200 plants per hour for a foot bath, less than 40 yuan, absolute enjoyment. That is, because of the increased publicity in the women\u2019s prison, all Chinese are queuing. The price ranges from low to high. I made a coconut oil set meal, one hour of coconut mud to exfoliate the whole body, one hour of coconut oil massage, it is completely sweet, I really want to take a bite by myself, it is comfortable, the price is 900, only 180RMB, It\u2019s in the ancient city, just press"

Loblinka has doors on all sides, the east is the main gate of the garden. After the security check, we walked slowly into the garden, a typical Tibetan style of garden, but other places can not see the style of garden and design. Roblinka is divided into palace area, palace front area, forest area 3 most. The eastern palace front area includes the former park before the entrance and the three-tiered pavilion of Weizhen; the central part of the palace area is the core part of the park; and the western part is a forest area characterized by natural jungle wildness. The forest area, which covers about half of the garden, is also very diverse, with not only the usual local flowers and trees, but also the odd plants from the Himalayas, and the valuable flowers transplanted from the Mainland or imported from abroad. The main buildings in the palace area include the golden chapter, kokyoin, and the chapter of yonehisa, which was newly built in 1954 years. A tour of the park is really big, it has the characteristics of the Tibet plateau, and it draws from the traditional methods of the inland Jiangnan gardens.

          "The Egyptian Museum in Cairo is over 100 years old. It contains so many Egyptian treasures that a new museum is being built closer to the Pyramids in Giza to house and better display all the treasures. It can be very crowded, so try to go in the afternoon. It is open on Thursday evenings from 5-9 pm and that is the best time to go because there are no crowds. I suggest you use the tour guide group \"Walk Like An Egyptian\" they are well respected, respond to emails quickly and are very knowledgeable. Going to the museum with a guide who can explain the importance of what you are seeing will greatly enhance your experience. There are so many treasures in this one building that you could spend months and never see them all. This is a certain\"must do\" even if you do not think you like museums you will like this one. The basic ticket does not include the Mummy Room, that is extra. But you will still see many mummy's, even if you do not pay to go to the Mummy Room. You will also see King Tut's treasure.",

Due to the political instability in Egypt, we will always see countless policemen maintaining the surrounding area from getting off the bus to the scenic spots. Therefore, it is very safe to travel to Egypt. I didn't feel much about this attraction before, but after I went there, I realized that it was a very meaningful attraction. The hanging church is a church for Christians. It is very small and cannot be compared with many famous churches. But since it is the first time for me to come to the church, I am deeply moved by the simplicity of this church and the strong atmosphere of faith. This church is generally ignored by tourists, so there are almost no faces of Chinese people, let alone the team. But the pious prayers of the local people in the church moved me very much. The church is a bit broken, but the atmosphere is quite good, and this attraction is free.",

          "Correct it first: it should be Feldberg, or Feldberg, not Feldberg (Ctrip should correct it). Feldberg National Park is located about 70 kilometers northwest of Hobart, Tasmania. Starting from Hobart, you will arrive at the High Trees Promenade Parking Lot. It is about an hour's drive away. This is the park's gate 2. The landscape in the national park is diverse, ranging from eucalyptus temperate rain forests to alpine swamps. Its highest point is Mount Feld at 1,434 meters above sea level. Field Hill National Park was established in 1916 and is the oldest national park in Tasmania along with Freycinet National Park in Wineglass Bay. Russell Falls in the park The area around Russell Falls has been protected since 1885 and is Tasmania's earliest nature reserve. The last wild thylacine was captured in the area in 1933. Prior to 1946, the protected area was called a \"national park\", and since 1947 it was renamed as it is today. Let\u2019s take the High Tree Walk, which is one of the 60 short-distance walks in Tasmania. The swamp almond eucalyptus in Field Hill is one of the tallest trees in Australia. While walking under the towering tree canopy, you can use an inclinometer to calculate the height of these trees! On the way to Russell Falls, I saw the Horseshoe Falls not far from the fork, so go and take a look first! After enjoying the Horseshoe Falls, turn back and go to Russell Falls. Because we were going to see the tall trees, we got off the car at the Gaoshu Group parking lot. Otherwise, we went directly to Russell Falls from the Feder Mountain National Park Visitor Center, which is much closer. Russell Falls cannot be said to be spectacular, but it is layered and exquisite, and it looks patchy with the surrounding lush vegetation. It is extraordinarily elegant and amazing. In addition to Russell Falls and Horseshoe Falls, there is also Lady Barron Falls in the park. Time is limited, and Lady Barron Falls will not go. The high tree group parking lot where we got off is in the middle, with Horseshoe Falls and Russell Falls to the northeast, and Lady Barron Falls to the southwest. If you want to watch the three waterfalls and the high tree ring road, it will take at least two and a half hours. Take another photo and stop for a while. It's hard to say, but we gave it 2 hours and 15 minutes. Seeing tall trees, Horseshoe Falls and Russell Falls, without turning back, take the Russell Falls Nature Walk, enjoy the dense rainforest along the way, observe the unique forest area of Tasmania, and meet with the guide at the visitor center. Figure 1: Field Hill National Park was listed as a Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Reserve in 2013; Figure 2: The 79-meter-high swamp almond eucalyptus tree cannot be photographed from the root neck to the top of the crown; Figure 5: View Russell Falls-look at the beautiful scenery that falls down into several layers along the mountain; Figure 10: Why is it called the Horseshoe Falls and is it shaped like a horseshoe? No way to know.",

This garden is free to visit. I went in the morning, avoiding the tour groups, and enjoying the quiet scenery in the garden alone, it was very pleasant!",
          "Fuzhou Garden is located in Naha, the capital of Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. It is a Chinese-style garden park open to citizens. Strolling here, leaning on a small bridge to watch the water, and leaning on the \"two towers\" to see the \"three mountains\", you will have the illusion of time and space, thinking that you have come to Fuzhou, Fujian, China. Yes, the \"Fuzhou Garden\" covering an area of 8,500 square meters is really authentic and was built by the Naha City Government with an investment of 900 million yen. The park is based on the \"three mountains, two towers and one river\" of Fuzhou, and is built using the landscape layout and artistic composition of traditional Chinese gardens, which is full of \"Chinese flavor\" in itself.",
          "The plaque at the gate is the words mentioned by Bing Xin, and the couplet is also very interesting, \"Urban Blind Date Becomes Sisters\", for me who was still in Fuzhou ten days ago, I must come and visit Fuzhou Garden. With a one-day ticket for the monorail, you can enjoy a group fare of 160 yen. The layout and architecture of the park are very distinctive, and there are two fat pigeons who love to rub oily fish food. A box of fish food for 100 yen can be fed to both swimming in the water and flying in the sky. The experience is also good. For the location, you can walk straight from the north exit of the prefectural hall for about 300 meters. If you go further, you can go to the cruise terminal, Naminoue Beach and the Shrine. You can go for a stroll together if you have time.",

The park is planted with a memorial tree symbolizing the friendship between the two cities. It has been 35 years since 2017. Representative Chinese elements can be seen everywhere in the park, such as the park\u2019s white walls, black carved windows, pavilions in the park, hanging red lanterns, the figures of the eight immortals crossing the sea on the bridge, and the zodiac , The Panlong Column in front of the house makes people feel like they are in China."

After getting off at Schaffhausen railway station, transfer to S33 to Schloss Laufen am Rheinfall station, or transfer to bus No. 1 and 6 to Neuhausen or Zentrum station. These two locations are located at both ends of the waterfall, and are connected by a cruise ship in the middle. If you have enough time, you can visit both ends to experience different perspectives. If time is tight, it is recommended to take the route of Schloss Laufen am Rheinfall station, because the viewing platform there is closer to the waterfall, and you can feel the powerful water coming on you. And the whole route is to go straight to the highest point of the castle, then walk a short distance to buy a ticket, and then go all the way down, one by one from the viewing platform to the pier, the route is relatively labor-saving. If you come from the other end, you have to climb up one by one.

Because it is windy and heavy and snowy, professional equipment is needed to go up, and basically nothing can be seen, so it is recommended that you buy the second stage), buy the second stage ropeway ticket If you don\u2019t have to come down at the first transfer station, just continue to sit, and then you can get down at the second transfer station. After you get down, you can easily see the ski resort. Don\u2019t worry about not finding your way. Then change your down jacket and down pants. You can get high!",

Contrary to domestic holidays, during Canadian public holidays (National Day, Christmas, New Year's Day, etc.), almost all shops, restaurants and entertainment venues are closed for rest. It is best for tourists to avoid visiting Toronto during the holidays. 2. Tips are required in Canada from eating, taking a taxi, to receiving various services (hairdressing, beauty, luggage handling, etc.). The rule of thumb is to pay 15[%] of the pre-tax price. 3. At railway stations, long-distance bus stations, hotels and major attractions, there will be information points where you can request free maps and tourist guides. In addition, visitors can also request different coupons to help save money."

After walking, you have seen a lot of deer along the way. The entrance fee of Mount Wakakusa is 150 yen, and the child is 80, which is very, very cheap. If you charge 100 in China, it will be considered kind. As soon as I entered the scenic spot, the child said that he wanted to go to the toilet. The aunt smiled and opened the door to let us out, and told us to come and let us in with the ticket stub. It was very friendly and nice. When I first entered Mount Wakakusa, it was a big grass slope. You can sit here and enjoy the scenery, but it was very windy that day. Moreover, my phone slipped down the slope, and everyone on the slope was watching. It was too embarrassing. Going up again is the first, second and the highest (and the most windy) third. The scenery of each double-meal is nice, very open, and there is also an ancient tomb in the triple-me. The deer will appear randomly, and there will be a bunch of triple eyes. Buy deer senbei at the door in advance and you can feed it. It is said that the deer of Mount Wakakusa are more obedient and less likely to hit people. Except for a few, it is still a bit fierce to be wary of those who have horns or have horns. Back down the original road, there are cherry trees along the way, if you catch the cherry blossoms, it should be more beautiful. If it's not because of the wind, it's really good, you must go to Nara.",
          "From the bottom of the mountain, the mountain is really bare and there is only a lawn, as if there is no tree. The mountain is fenced off for a week. You need to get a ticket. The mountain is not high and suitable for walking. There are many deer under the mountain."

The Spiderman Ride was my absolute favorite because of how accurately interactively 3D it was. The hollwood dream ride was also fun. They have both front-faced and backdrop for the Hollywood Dream ride. I think the Backdrop one is more challenging than the one we tried. I especially enjoyed the Shark ride as well. Overall, USJ made me geniunely happy in 1 day. I basically forgot all of my problems that day, and that's thanks to USJ. \u2665\ufe0f",

I have never had the opportunity to go in and stroll around. But this time I finally arranged to stay for one night, but it happened on Monday again. The museum is closed, which is also very depressing. When I went to eat in the evening, I passed by and took a picture of the appearance. After lighting up, it became more obvious in the grass and looked very beautiful. To be honest, Japanese museums like this European style very much, whether in Kyoto, Nara or Tokyo. Many treasures in the museum are now in the Tokyo Museum, so if you go to Tokyo, it is more suitable to go in."

Since then, he has lived, lived and lived in this green space, exhausting the rest of his life to independently complete the overall planning blueprint of the park and all the sculpture designs.

The second stage: as the fountain of life. The third stage: the pillar of life. The fourth stage: the wheel of life.

          "This church is stunning. I usually try to make a trip to a local church in every foreign city I visit; this one was worth the wait. Without knowing it, I stumbled into the church in the evening when a children\u2019s choir was performing. It being Christmas time, needless to say, it was magical. I didn\u2019t want to disturb the concert, so made a mental note to return the following day when the cathedral would be empty. What gorgeous architecture. The ceiling of this place seemed endless. It was quiet and peaceful and a perfect place to spend a half hour admiring the design, even if most of the descriptions were in Norwegian.       The church is surrounded by the sweetest yard-light snow had fallen on the ground. I would absolutely recommend this, even to people who are not particularly religious, because it\u2019s hard to overlook the History and architecture in such a massive and beautiful place.",

The way to enter the park is in the river, cross the sea cable car or ferry, we are going back and forth, natural selection is tried, the purpose is to feel different scenery! The whole park is divided into three parts, mechanical park area, zoo area and sea play area, because live on the island ( next post to add accommodation), really play for two days and one night, the corners of the side are strolled, can say only stay on the island, can see the night view of the park.

          "\u2705Traffic guide: To stay in a hotel on Pearl Island, you first need to go to the Pearl Island Pier, where there is a check-in lobby. Swipe the card directly to take the cable car without queuing up. There are 5 of us on the cable car. The sky is gradually darkening. The scenery is really beautiful. The cable car opens very slowly. There will be small windows blowing in the sea breeze. Looking at the scenery on both sides of the sea, it is very beautiful. The cable car time is 15 minutes, and after coming down, the Pearl Island Amusement Park. \u2714\ufe0fOur room number is 4409. We only found out that it was so far when we arrived. We still have to go up the mountain. I can't see it clearly at night. The driver will send you directly to the door of the neat little villas. The moment I swiped the card to enter the door, I was still amazed. The two-bedroom villa, one floor, three bathrooms, one kitchen (without pots), the living room area is super large, there are some cold drinks and snacks in the refrigerator, not many, one for two rooms There is a double bed, a double bed, and both have separate bathrooms. Although the master and the second bedroom can be separated, the difference in area is not too much. It does not matter if you live in two separate families. There is a small swimming pool in front of the living room, which is not very big, but It's enough, there are deck chairs outside. The overall decoration style of the villa is European, not luxurious, and relatively simple. We are very satisfied with the room at this price. It is estimated that it can be booked in Nha Trang. If it is estimated to be 5000+ in Hainan, the evaluation of the room is two. Great value! \u2714\ufe0fYou can play in the private pool of the villa. If you are tired, take a bubble bath in the bathtub and sleep beautifully. The next day, you can set off to the playground \ud83d\uddfc\ud83c\udfa1\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa0\ud83c\udfdd\ud83c\udfd6. \u2714\ufe0fBehind the hotel lobby is the hotel\u2019s swimming pool. In front is the sea. There are not many people on the beach. There are deck chairs, towels, and swimming rings. The sand here is white and soft. It\u2019s not very delicate. The sea is clear and clean. , This is the finest sand and the clearest sea I have ever seen. The sea in downtown Nha Trang is really not comparable to here. It must be praised. I found that the seawater here has high salinity, and the waves are small, let alone surfing. Basically, I can\u2019t feel the bigger waves. The children come to the beach to feel the waves after another, but there is no such thing. A lot less fun to play. The child had to walk along the beach to search for shells and play for a while, and then went to the swimming pool to play. The water in the swimming pool did not know if it was warmed up, and it would not feel uncomfortable when it first entered the water. It was super comfortable."

Some particularly colourful Vietnamese touches include the red neon outlining the crucifix, the pink back-lighting on the tabernacle and the blue neon arch and white neon halo over the statue of St Mary.

There is also a water world inside. You need to make a car to go there. There is no need to line up. The mud wash is completely smooth and more comfortable than a mask. It is recommended to play other items first and take a mud bath at the end. You don\u2019t need to use soap and make a spa for your skin. The only drawback may be the distance from the city. Ctrip tickets are cheaper than buying them on-site. Please attach the picture and do the calculation yourself.",

The booked Koike is \u00a587, and the front desk retail price is 300,000 dong, so Ctrip's price is advantageous. This price also includes the hot spring pool. Ctrip will send an electronic confirmation number and an appointment code. At the front desk of i-resort, just hand the confirmation number and reservation code to the receptionist, watch her enter the information into the PAD, and it will be OK. There is also a Chinese-speaking receptionist at the front desk. There is a SPA pavilion next to the hot spring pool, which is charged separately. We bought the tickets directly at the front desk and made an appointment. 300,000 dong, 50 minutes. At the entrance of the dressing room, a large towel, a key to the locker cabinet, and a bottle of mineral water will be given to each person with a ticket. Towels are only distributed once, not unlimited times. The cabinet is also relatively small. When you go to the hot mineral mud bath, remember to bring the ticket and collect it. There is a place to hang towels by the pool. The size of the small pool is 1 to 3 people, but when there are few people, it can be enjoyed by one person. When there are many people, I don\u2019t know how to solve it. Next to it is the sun shade, which can be retracted. After the previous group of people leave, the staff will immediately release the mud in the pool and flush it with a high-pressure water gun. Because there were not many people and relatively empty, the staff asked which pool to choose. After the selection, they opened the valve to pour the mud and it was full soon. Then I told him for 20 minutes and walked away. The mud in the i-resort hot spring resort contains extremely high mineral silica. Slowly dive into the bottom of the mud pool to completely cover every inch of skin with the warm mud. The mud bath looks dirty, but after washing it will make the skin white and slippery. After washing up, soak in the hot spring, which is quite pleasant. Hot mineral mud baths, hot springs, and SPA are the essence of i-resort! So in the next 20 minutes, soak for a while. The mud is not as viscous as expected, but it's actually quite thin, but it's warm and comfortable. It almost came with a stopwatch. As soon as 20 minutes arrived, the staff came over, pointed at the watch, and then opened the valve at the bottom corner. The mud in the pool slowly lowered, and the neck, chest, and waist were gradually exposed. water surface. Bring a towel to wash, there is a special washing spray room for washing mud. After that, you can choose to soak in the hot spring pool, squint on the lounger, or go to eat. There are many places to kill time anyway. After sitting for a while, go to the SPA. In fact, you can also lie down and rest for a while, or take a foot bath. Give the ticket to the front desk, let's wait a moment, and arrange it. A waiter served hot ginger tea. The environment is okay, very quiet, with soothing background music, it's really relaxing, I feel like taking a nap. Loose bones, essential oils, pinch, massage, a set of procedures to walk down, feel refreshed, ears and eyes. If you have plenty of time, you can book a package for the water park, and there is a shuttle bus. Unless you bring children, you can play with the water in the hot spring pool. I went out to the gate and prepared to call a car to Zhongyu Shijiao. The receptionist asked me the direction to go, and took them to the parking lot of their resort. The 7-seater car, not from the taxi company, was the resort\u2019s own car. The body has a LOGO and a meter. The condition of the car is very new. If you see the receptionist still recording the license plate and time with a notebook, just take it."

Long Son is a Buddhist temple that suffered quite a bit of damage in the Vietnam war, but has since been brought back to its former glory. The temple itself can be found near the road, but for those wanting to experience some fantastic views of Nha Trang and its surrounds, take the stairs to the right (152, to be precise!) and you\u2019ll find yourself at the foot of a massive statue of the Buddha. Keep an eye out for the young touts at the temple, as they will probably try and take you on a \u2018free\u2019 guided tour. While you\u2019re not obliged to pay up, they WILL put the pressure on at the conclusion of the tour!",

You will notice that not just the munks but also most of the Asian tourists pray and worship when they're visiting. If there's a negative thing to point out its all the litter and garbage around.

          "Intramuros (La Ciudad Murada/ The Walled City) was capital of the entire archipelago during the 300-year rule of the Spaniards. Housing the provincial houses of the major religious orders, their schools, and the palaces of the civil government as well as large warehouses for Spanish trade goods and military ammunition, Intramuros was the center of the humongous Spanish Empire in Asia. If there is one sole original structure within Intramuros, it is none other than San Agust\u00edn Church, the only connection of any person to the history, art and culture of pre-War Intramuros. It is an exquisite repository of local Baroque designs and fixtures. Built in 1581, it is a UNESCO heritage site. If there is one museum in Intramuros you must visit, it is this one. Inaugurated in 1975 by the former Principe de Asturias (eventually King) Juan Carlos de Borbon and former Princess Sof\u00eda, it holds a vast collection of Augustinian and ecclestiastical arts and artifacts saved through the years. The former monastery gives visitors a veritable feel of the religious life in one of Intramuros\u2019 seven convents, with its manicured gardens and patios, stone staircase and cloister or clausura lined with religious paintings. Plaza San Luis Complex. A reconstructed compound, it resembles a Spanish colonial residential enclave. Entering it gives you a semblance of what it was like to enter the mansions of pre-War Intramuros. Currently, it houses souvenir shops and Barbara\u2019s, one of a few dining options in Intramuros. Although the Barbara\u2019s in the upper floor is quite formal in set-up, you can enjoy a more relaxed dining experience at the first floor, surrounded by plants and white-washed stone walls. Sometimes, rondalla music would accompany you here. Manila Cathedral. Destroyed during the Liberation of Manila in 1945, the current building was rebuilt in 1958 through the efforts of the first Filipino Cardinal, Archbishop Rufino Cardinal Santos. "

It occupies a place in the history of world architecture and is called \"open-air museum\". There is a market selling souvenirs and local specialties near the square, so you can visit and play together. Unfortunately, on April 25, 2015, a magnitude 8.1 earthquake occurred in Nepal, and most of the buildings in Patan Durbar Square were damaged. Among them, the Khalisanka Temple and the Charnarayan Temple completely collapsed, and the Yuganalandra \u00b7The top statue of Mara King Pillar was dropped and damaged.",

The colorful flags are almost the same as the ones in Tibet. We can't see the difference. I don't know when it started, the colorful flags have become a standard religious symbol. Dogs on the roof is here. We saw a scene where the domestic dogs barked and wandered on the roof. No dog was led and bent on the road. This is a major feature. The world is so amazing!",

The Royal Palace located in the center is also the Patan Museum. It is the focus of the visit, but if you are not particularly interested in Nepal\u2019s emperor history or ancient architecture (especially for friends who travel poorly), you don\u2019t need to enter the palace and just take pictures outside.",

The following are some of the'preparation matters' that we want to share with netizens after we play in the park: -1) The three months from March to June are the dry season in Bangkok, with an average temperature of 35 degrees or a body temperature of more than 40 degrees. Above, in order to prevent the skin from being'burned' by the'strong' ultraviolet rays, it is necessary to apply sunscreen to yourself or children. 2) When playing in the park, it is also recommended to wear sun protection gloves and a \u2018cap\u2019 on your arms. 3) Bring a small umbrella, after all, umbrellas can not only block the rain, but also shade. 4) \"Physique\" friends who like to attract mosquitoes also suggest not to miss the mosquito repellent. Although our trip did not provoke mosquitoes, after all, the park is an outdoor place, and we don\u2019t need to find the body after returning to the hotel. 'Invaded' shamelessly by the hateful mosquito. . . 5) Don't'forget' to drink more water when playing. We suggest to play all the way from the right hand side of the map provided by the park (see attached picture), and then to the exit (or entrance) from the right hand side at the \"end\", so that basically all the play facilities can be covered , Travellers with children may wish to consider taking the children to take a few photo spots at the entrance to \"souvenirs\", then \"play with the \"water bike\" on the 7th, and then come back to take the cable 5 that opens at 11 am The train and the No. 6 Dream World Sightseeing Train will not waste some time. Basically, there are not many tourists in the park, and the queue for individual rides generally does not exceed 10 minutes. . . Since the \"entry ticket\" provided by the park is a post with a number to be affixed to the clothes, the staff of the amusement park will roughly \"check\" before playing various amusement measures, so try to \"protect\" as much as possible, especially Water activities, although they usually see foreign tourists, they will be \"accommodating\", but after all, the \"token\" in hand, the heart is relatively secure. . . I hope this sharing can bring some help to travelers who are interested in visiting this park. I wish you a happy journey and a safe and smooth journey~~"

It is estimated that Morocco had a high acceptance of European architectural styles at the end of the 19th century. In these stained glass interiors, you can take very artistic photos. I helped my wife to take a photo of \"Waiting in the Boudoir\", which was widely praised by the members of the tour group."

There are many orange trees planted in the sunken garden of the palace, and the pool in the middle of the garden has no vitality, but when walking here, you can imagine the exquisiteness and beauty of its heyday. It must be a very beautiful palace.",

If you want to visit here in full, it takes a lot of time. There is a museum (free). There is also a sermon history of Koutabia Monastery, but an extra ticket is required.",

The scale of the palace is quite large, with a large pool in the middle, and the city gate platform has a good angle to enjoy the panoramic view of the city."

Opening time: The mountaineering train has a timetable, basically starting at 7:00 in the morning, and the last train is 6, 7:00 in the afternoon when you come back. Winter and summer time is not the same, must see the time clearly, and hurry back to Zermatt before the last train, otherwise it will be miserable. Of course, there are several good hotels on the halfway up the mountain, if you can't come back, stay in the hotel, in case there is no room, sleep in the snow. Ticket price: Remember it seems to be 94 Swiss francs, if there is a Swiss pass to discount, this price can be hop-on hop-off, convenient for tourists to go down at each stop to see the scenery, or a short hike. Highlights: Besides Zermatt, the train stops five stops, and it's a ski resort in winter, and many people from all over Europe take all their skiing gear up and down, even in April, when the snow is all over the mountain. It's a hiker's paradise in summer, and Switzerland does make a special trip. The five stations are the Findelbach, Riffelalp, Riffelberg, Rotenboden and Gornergrat. When it is snowy in winter, the first two stops are mainly skiing, and the scenery is nothing special compared to the top. The third stop is Riffelberg, which has a super red hotel Riffelhaus 1853( River House 1853. The reason for this hotel's red is the outdoor SPA pool in the snow, which can enjoy the spa and watch the Matthong Peak. (I will also send a post about this hotel.) The second last stop, Rotenboden, is also famous, especially in summer, when it's not too far down the hill from the lake, which is not big, but the reflection of the Matterhorn on the surface and the green grass on the lake's edge make for a beautiful landscape. Many photographers and beautiful women are drawn to the train. But the ice on the lake in winter doesn't exist. The train seems to be coming twice to see the different views of the Matterhorn in winter and summer. The last stop is the viewing platform, there is a large building, inside the observatory, restaurant, chapel, even a hotel (this hotel may be the highest in Europe, the environment is average, although high but not net red, the price more than 2000 is not cheap. Personally recommend the Riffelhaus above. Tourists can take a square break and have lunch or something. From here, I feel close to the Matterhorn Peak, and of course I can also enjoy the Alps glacier Gornergletscher and the continuous snow mountain, all of them are snow-capped, very spectacular. Small Tips: It's much easier to get down. Many locals ski down. In the summer, they hike down to the middle of the mountain. The scenery is beautiful and not very tired. However, most people get down by train. Entertainment experience: When you reach the top of the mountain three kilometers, some people may have a high altitude reaction. Because they basically take the mountain train, so the physical effort is not too much. This is much better than the domestic mountain climbing, which is basically walking. Many cable cars come down with a lot of roads to walk, (such as Huangshan), and the experience is not good. If you are like the Swiss Matterhorn or Jungfrau, the transportation can drive directly to the viewing attractions, even if it is more expensive, I believe that it can attract many tourists.",
          "The best angle to see the Matterhorn. From Zermatt Railway Station, take the cogwheel mountain train to the terminal. The round-trip price is 45 Swiss francs with the pass. In the middle, you can get off the bus and go around the station and then continue to ride, but each ticket gate can only enter and exit once. The top of the mountain is mainly a viewing platform and restaurant, but there will be many people getting off at the Rotenboden station just before the terminal because it is the most convenient place to see the reflection of the Matterhorn on the lake. After getting off the bus, walk along the road signs for 5-10 minutes and you will be in front of a small lake where you can see the reflection, preferably on a windless day."

The round trip cable car costs 100 Swiss francs.",
          "Drive to trasch railway station and take the train to zermat. The local tyrant\u2019s method is to use paragliders and helicopters, with more than 1,000 soft coins per capita. The middle class method is the cable car. There are also many cable car lines, there is always one suitable for you. In view of the status quo of the stock market, we have been beaten back to the Diaosi prototype, so we adopt the most primitive way of walking. Of course, there is also a way to force the frame to synchronize with the plane and the paraglider but to abuse itself, namely the bicycle. In view of the fact that the Swiss are all athletes, although we are a big country with gold medals, we still cannot compare with them. It was only two and a half hours, so I couldn't visit the highest peak, but I saw her mystery from different angles. The mystery is mainly caused by clouds and fog. There are several roads for climbing in the village. The biggest surprise is the cabins along the way. Switzerland is actually a mountainous country with small wooden houses dotted in the mountains and flowers dotted outside the wooden houses. This is probably love of life. Those who are walking through the mountains and have to ride on a flat surface or climb on a stone naturally have a sickly love of life, haha. Another accident was that the neck was covered with plateau red, like a red necklace. It has been 4 days and it hasn't gone down yet.",
          "I saw the reflection of the snow-capped mountains on the lake online. It was very beautiful. I went to see it hopefully, but I was disappointed because I went too early. In April, it was still icy and snowy, and the lake was completely covered in snow. But the photos of the snow scenes I took are still beautiful, and I saw a lot of skiing dolls. They still need an adult report when they get off the car. But they are as light as a swallow when skiing and very cute.",
          "Spectacular! It is recommended to wear sunglasses! I was dazzled by the snow \u2744\ufe0f, haha I will definitely come to ski next time! It is very fun to see many foreigners skating. I heard that they can slip from the border of Italy to the border of Switzerland. It is a very comfortable journey. The small cable car goes all the way to the top of the mountain. The pictures are beautiful! The underground ice room is also beautiful",
          "The Matterhorn glacier paradise is the place with the most Swiss characteristics in my opinion. The happy Swiss people, old and young, skilfully slide down the high snow peaks with a pair of skis, so we can only be on the cable car. Watching the Chinese old people look at the snow and sigh. But the scenery is really good. You can watch the Matterhorn up close, which is really majestic."

I have been there 3 times and security has been stepping up so always try to be early, because there\u2019s always a long queue at battery park to 1. clear security 2. to board the ferry/cruise to reach the Statue of Liberty island. I will suggest having your meals beforehand as there are limited food options on the Statue of Liberty island. Remember to purchase your tickets online days or months before your planned visit as tickets might run out fast. the option includes going up the pedestal of the statue and all the way up but I feel that the pedestal is sufficient, note that there\u2019s a museum at the pedestal that talks about the history of the statue. u can stay on the island as long as u want so try to get the earlier tickets if u would like to take your time to enjoy the breeze on the island (but it\u2019s cold during winter) and visit the museum on the island.. I took the ferry back when the sun was setting, u can see the Manhattan skyline and it\u2019s beautiful",

",
          "This is the centre of NYC where the city never sleeps. if you love the hustle and bustle with ever constant crowds then Time's Square is your place. be warned \"heaps of people\". I'm not a big fan of excessive crowds, but that's just me. You may love it though.",
          "If you are in New York for the first time, you must go to Time Square. Forget about the talk that it is a tourist trap, is not. Take a lot of pictures and be amazed with the place",
          "We went to Good Morning America early one morning so I got to see Times Square very quiet. Then later in the day we went back and it was a madhouse. So if you want to see it without people, go at 6:00am! Otherwise it will always be slammed with people. Also, there\u2019s a big coffee shop on the corner right there and the coffee tastes like dirt, but they do have a bathroom."

There are many classics on Fifth Avenue, including the Empire State Building, New York Public Library, Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick's Church, Central Park, and so on.

Compared with the valuables in the luxury stores on Fifth Avenue, the interaction between celebrities and melon-eaters on Vanity Fair is the protagonist of the global drama on Fifth Avenue.

However, even if you don\u2019t have a shopping plan, you can take a stroll on the Fifth Avenue section. The best section should be midtown and uptown. If you have good feet, you can go to downtown.

          "I wanted to write about the Shiroi Koibito Factory and Sapporo Ramen Street, but there is no such option in Ctrip. Instead, there is Odori Park. Ha ha. Then post a few pictures of the park. In fact, Ramen Street is more worth visiting. In just one street, a lot of famous shops are concentrated here, I feel that my stomach is too small to eat so much. Just stay a few more days. The ramen tastes good, but it's not expensive at all. Just remember: Please place an order and pay on the machine in the store first. It is not collected manually. There are photos on the machine, and it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t understand Japanese. If you can't find the machine, find the clerk, they will teach you. In short, Sapporo is very interesting, the city is very clean, but there are no trash cans on the street, you have to take the trash home by yourself. But it is still worth going. You can also visit the shrine."

The park is very large. It would be cruel to walk in summer. Fortunately, there is a battery car that can take you to where you want to go.

It is a park with many places to see, including sea view, monuments and monuments. The view over the Yokohama Bay Bridge and the boat across the harbour is quite romantic. Many of the monuments here can feel the rich interaction with foreign countries, such as the \"Indian Water Tower\" donated by the Japan Indian Association in 1937 and the \"Water Guard\" donated by the sister city of Santiago, USA. In addition, the \"Rose Garden of the Future\" is about 160 roses and about 1,900 flowers blooming each spring and autumn are also a good place to see.",
          "Yamashita Park is one of the landscapes facing Yokohama Port. The park is not large and it is backed by Chinatown Subway Station. It is very convenient to visit. There are also coastal scenic spots such as the Red Brick Warehouse and Mirai 21 going north. The location of the park is made of reclaimed sea, without the twists and turns of the natural coast, and the straight trails and the smooth breakwaters are also fun. There are many landscape towers and museums around the park. If you plan well, stay here for one or two nights. Comfortable."

Yokohama Yakage Island Sealand is an amusement park built on Yakage Island. Located at the end of Yokohama Bay, it is a new amusement park and one of Japan's best aquariums.",
          "First of all, the surprise: there is a beach on the island, the sea is very clear, as for the aquarium, it is not as big as it is supposed to be, the legendary 4 museums, one of which is a variety of marine life, or quite rich, but the other 3 are small. The second pavilion has a couple of seals (which can be done for a few minutes) and a small outdoor animal show outside. The third pavilion has a glass passage about 10 meters long, with dolphins and fish swimming overhead, which can be done in a few minutes. The last one is the Ocean Farm, an open air promenade similar to the event docks built at sea, free to visit (which is boring) or spend a few dozen dollars fishing. Fishing fish seems to take home",
          "Located at the end of Yokohama Bay, it is a new type of amusement park and one of the best aquariums in Japan. I heard from my friends that this is the first wave roller coaster built in Japan. It was very exciting to play, and I was right. There are specialty shops, gourmet restaurants, and a promenade and hotel hidden in the greenery and gardens.",
          "Hakkeijima is filled out just like Odaiba. The main function is to play, including an amusement park and aquarium. The island itself is free, and there are fees for play items. In addition, there are places where you want to live, and the prices are naturally different. The more distinctive projects are sea amusement facilities, such as roller coasters on the water, because the island itself is in the sea, and the aquarium is also well connected to the natural environment, and has its own advantages compared with high-rise buildings.",
          "There is a large central tank that is very shocking, countless sardines and sharks, super big devil fish and turtles swimming together, the performance of marine animals is also wonderful, and there is an interactive pool with marine animals, you can go into the water and touch it. So the children are not happy to play."

From a distance, I thought it was a Ferris wheel. Few rides. Because it is connected to the entire Future 21 Port, basically people who come to play will stop by and have a look. The popularity is still relatively high. At night, when the ferris wheel glows, there are digital timekeeping on it, which is very beautiful. For other amusement facilities, there are haunted houses and roller coasters in the park. However, the land in Japan is too small. No interest anymore.",

It is a great experience to ride the Ferris wheel here to the top of the tallest building in the city. Other fun places (navigation on waterways, roller coasters, etc.) are also fun. There is also a playground and snack street. Space World is opposite a big mall, this mall has many places to eat and some food supermarkets",

There are also several haunted houses here for daring people to try.",

It integrates various scenery in the four seasons and houses buildings from different eras, making it an important place in Japanese garden architecture. This garden was originally built by Yokohama's rich businessman Futaro (alias Sankei) all his life. A wide and beautiful Japanese garden covering an area of 180,000 square meters with flowers blooming throughout the four seasons. The historical buildings in the park were moved from Kyoto and Nara, and some have been designated as important cultural relics. Sanxi Garden is a beautiful, elegant and exquisite traditional landscape garden with a total area of 47 acres (190,000 square meters). 16 ancient buildings with a history of hundreds of years are set against ponds and hills. Sanxi Garden is derived from three streams name. There are ancient buildings from various places in the park, such as the Beezhuang Linchun Pavilion of the Kishu Tokugawa family, the Pagoda of Tenzui Temple built by Guan Bai and Taishou Minister Toyotomi Hideyoshi for the birthday of the mother, and the Wolkaden in Fushimi Castle, Tensho-in Temple in Kamakura, the Buddhist hall of the old Tokeiji Temple, the tea room Tingqiu Pavilion built for Nijo Castle by the third general of the Tokugawa shogun, Tokugawa Iemitsu, the tea room Harukaryo built for Yurakusai during the period of Oda Nobunaga, Toku Tomboji Temple The triple tower and so on. Various buildings are built according to different topography is the characteristic of Sanxi Garden. The Triple Pagoda of Yakushiji Temple is located in Nishinokyo-cho, Nara City, Japan. This tower was built in the Asuka area. Haraji was moved from Asuka to Nara in 718 after Heijokyo (the capital of the Fujiwara clan) was established. After the old temple was caught in fire, only this three-storied pagoda (also known as the east pagoda) was left. Therefore, it was most noble and was later designated as a national cultural treasure by the Japanese government. The tower is 33.8 meters high. Known as one of the most beautiful ancient stupas in Japan. When we look carefully at this temple tower, we will find its shape is very special. It is different from the temple tower structure in ancient China, the double eaves are uneven, and the tower body is placed among the trees, as if isolated. It seems that the architectural form is not uniform enough, and it has an inclusive feature. For example, each layer of the tower body has its own characteristics, and the upper and lower floors are not unified; the pillars of each layer are not bulging, they are flush with the wall, and are integrated into the entire tower itself; the bucket arch supporting the pillars is no different. The cooperation with the various ministries appears to be balanced and appropriate. Therefore, every building is full of a sense of harmony.",

When I went there were basically old people visiting, not many young people. But I guess it didn't meet the right season with me. The leaves were still very green in early November."

With the traditional Hakata Ganyu Garden Mountain Festival in 770 years, \u308a has been listed by the United Nations as the world's intangible cultural property. And the starting point of the detour is the Putian Jinja shrine.

Even in the autumn leaves season in September, it is still quiet like a small town or a filming location for a certain movie. The sand in the seaside park is a bit yellow, but the sea is still blue. There is a cruise ship dock in the waterfront park, but unfortunately we missed the time to sail. The sea is calm, and the reflection of the Hilton Hotel not far away is so clear. The shells washed up by the waves can be seen everywhere, bowing their heads and picking them up. My daughter piled them up into hills, and then threw them back to the sea one by one, because the sea is their home. If you are hungry, you can find a small shop on the beach, basking in the sun, looking at the sea, eating lunch, and lazily killing your time. Very laid-back place."

There is a car rental agency opposite the JR Onuma Park, where you can rent bicycles and electric cars. I rented a bicycle to go around the lake, and if I had enough time, I could ride farther. There are fewer tourists in the distance, and I feel better. 4. The photos I took have not been photographed at all, just taken with an Apple phone, the real scenery is much more beautiful than the photos. 5. The core of the scenic spot is a small part of the lake and artificial buildings. I think it is very ordinary, just like an ordinary park in our city. The truly beautiful scenery still surrounds the Great Lake. Please see the map I sent. 6. In addition, I found that Ctrip\u2019s instructions stated that renting a bicycle is 1,000 yen per hour. I can correct it. At least when I go to Onuma Park on October 20, 2019, renting a bicycle is 1,000 yen per day. The rent for two hours is less, and normally two hours is enough to go around the Great Lake. 7. When I rented a car, there were a few Chinese girls renting an electric car. One of the girls told me that she bargained with the owner for two hours of rent for three hours. I saw the owner's grandfather laughing and nodding. That grandfather also told me the cycling route in English, and he was very cute with a smile. [Scenery] [Interesting] [Cost-effective]"

The top floor introduces the historical source of Goryokaku. The key point is to have a bird's eye view of the park and the city of Hakodate. It is worth a visit!",

There was no rubbish anywhere.     On the first morning, we went to the Golden Pavilion.A building in there was package by gold foil. You can learn something about Japan Temples in there.       Talking about foods, we had sushi and sashimi for lunch. They were super fresh and tasty.If you come to Kyoto, a bowl of stretched noodles is a must! You can taste all kinds of Japanese stretched noodles in there.  The next day, we went to Nara by subway. Don\u2019t worry about transportation, The subay, the bus, and the train are all convenient. We saw the biggest wooden building in the world, the Todaji Temple. Then we fed deers. There were many deers anywhere in Nara. I wonder where did they sleep. You can buy deers\u2019food in Nara Park. Please remember put the deers\u2019food in a plastic bag, so deers may follow you to get the food. The roast Japan Beef is a good choice for lunch. I ate a lot.

Nearby, the Museum of History and Folklore has cultural artifacts in a 19th-century merchant's home.",

It is best to take one copy in Japanese and Chinese. The places marked in the Japanese version are more detailed. If you play all over the island, it will be a busy day. Because there were no red leaves during May 1st, so I didn't go all the way up the mountain before, and swayed around Itsukushima Shrine and nearby. It\u2019s a five-minute walk from the pier to Itsukushima Shrine. It\u2019s less likely to walk by the water. It is recommended that you finish reading the Itsukushima Shrine before heading to the shopping street inside. It is best to determine the high tide and low tide time before you come. The two times are completely different at Itsukushima Shrine. If you stay for another day or at night, it is highly recommended to watch the sunset at Otorii."

I can't even put into words how I felt the entire time I went through the museum and even walking the grounds of where all the destruction occurred. The reigning message that was spread throughout this place was definitely of peace. Peace after such tragedy and horror. I recommend visiting this place to really get a sense of how it would feel, even just a tiny bit, if our lives were to ever be affected by such a catastrophic event. So powerful.

The large torii gate is close to one kilometer from the pier, and the scenery is very good when walking along the beach. It's almost a good time to go to the highest or lowest tide point.

According to history, it is said that it was built during the Hideyoshi era, but it has not been completed since it was suspended midway. The loft is located on the top of a small hill. After climbing a section of the mountain road, you can see this simple color Senjokaku, which is completely different from the Itsukushima Taisha below. Qiandi is a unit of area, but there is no concept of how big it is. After seeing it, it is really a super large platform with a very wide view. There is an extended platform on the side facing the sea. You can sit on it and look out. It is also officially because it is not completed. On the contrary, it seems very imposing, which can be regarded as a characteristic of the Azuchi era. The wooden pavilion is covered with various plaques, and they are basically all Chinese calligraphy, which is consistent with the Chinese aesthetic habits. In addition, there are many pictures with rich colors. But there are no things that belong to that era, and all that can be seen are added by later generations. It's always recommended. Together with the five-storied pagoda, it is a place worth visiting.",

It is the largest building on the island and is used as a memorial hall for Toyonari Hideyoshi's soldiers who died. It is composed of 857 tatami mats, hence the name Qianho Pavilion. But Hideyoshi died before he finished making it, and now he still keeps the way he hadn't finished making it. Except for the upper part of the statue seat, no patio has been built, and there is no siding, and it has been preserved in the above-mentioned unfinished state. In the Edo period, it was loved as a place for communication and enjoying the coolness. Therefore, the name of the Kabuki performers at the time, Kabuki (17-character short poem), etc. are recorded on the large pillar. In the Meiji era, it was officially renamed Toyokuni Shrine to honor him and Kato Kiyomasa.",

          "Mabul Island (Mabul Island) is about 45 minutes away from the town of Senbona, not a pure tourist island about 2,000 people, and some Bahu people, the island has a base of the Mabu Island, about 15 minutes away from the famous dive resort Shibadan. It's the nearest island to Shibadan.",
          "This Senbona's Mabu Island is really great. His beach and his tax is really great and well worth going. Their big boats are very safe, one can sit fifty or sixty people on the boat. Wow, people everywhere can see it. It's not the star grade in the house. It's the local kids. They don't have that race. They sell all kinds of seafood every day there. They can buy it and eat it."

The marine park consists of eight islands and while you are there, you should definitely go hiking in Boheydulang. The 600-metre trail takes about 40 minutes. It is a bit of a challenge when it gets steep, but trust me the view from the top is absolutely worth a million dollars.",
          "A paradise for diving lovers, a utopia for ocean addicts\n    There is such a place in Malaysia, she is far away from the crowd, with beautiful sky, ocean, beach blue sky, clear sea like the sky. This is Semporna, originally just a small fishing village, later developed into a well-known tourist city and a paradise for diving enthusiasts. This is a place that many people yearn for in their dreams, and it is also a fairyland that has been on fire on various online video apps. Semporna literally means perfect in Malay. When you reach Semporna, you will find that this small island is worthy of the name. It is perfect, because there are the most beautiful sky and clouds, making people confused whether it is in the world or in the sky. There are mainly four charming islands in the surrounding area, namely Mabu Island, Kappa Rai Island, Mabul Island and Bang Bang Island. These small islands are all surrounded by sea water, just like a dream island in the real world. There are the most beautiful fairy tales, the most innocent children. There is no noisy car whistle, no hustle and bustle of people, and inner peace, where you can hear the sound of the sea.\n    The seawater resources here are very well protected, the visibility of the seawater is very high, there are many corals and they are well protected. This is not only an ideal place for beginner divers and intermediate divers to enjoy the fun of deep-sea diving, but also a good place to satisfy underwater photographers. If you have friends who like to shoot VOLG, you must choose here. There is a vertical diving shrine with a depth of 100 meters on the west coast of Madang Island. Beautiful corals of various shapes are one of the characteristics of Madajon Island. It is also a paradise for many manatee animals and fishes.\n    There is a must-visit island in Dunsakaran Marine Park called Pearl Island, surrounded by a large area of corals and slopes on the outside of the island. It is a very good place to see the panoramic view and photography of Dunsakalang. All of his photographs are from here. But you have to climb up from the bottom of the mountain by yourself. The mountain road is rugged and there is no real road. It takes about forty minutes to climb up with both hands and feet. However, you will find it all worthwhile to reach the summit with a 360-degree unobstructed view of the entire sea. .",

          "4 reasons to come to Robert WAN Pearl Museum:\n1. The only black pearl museum in the world. After enjoying the natural beauty of the outer islands, before returning to the main island to board an international flight, learn about Tahiti black pearls and expand their knowledge. This is also a discussion resource after returning to China;\n2. Black pearls are a specialty of Tahiti. But to be honest, pearls are a bit like jade. Those who don\u2019t know how to do it may look the same. If you don\u2019t put them together, you may not see much difference. So if you want to buy jewelry, it\u2019s better to know about it. Spent money for nothing~\n3. The museum was funded and built by the famous Chinese Wen Huiren, also named Robert WAN. It has chain stores in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Dubai. The brand is guaranteed and the after-sales service is guaranteed. It is hard to come here. If you want to buy it, you will naturally buy the best.\n4. There are Chinese explanations, Chinese shopping guides, and Chinese tax refund guides. You can call to make an appointment to pick up the car. If you shop, you can also send it back to the hotel for free.",
          "The Robert Wan Pearl Museum mainly displays Tahiti's specialties, precious black pearls. Various crafts made of black pearls are very exquisite here. At the same time, the collection process of pearls and the identification standards of pearl size are also exhibited. The price is about 30[%] cheaper than a domestic treasure.",
          "The Robert Wan Pearl Museum is very worth coming. It is really beautiful. It was founded by French Chinese. Here you can see the development process of pearl cultivation. It displays many beautiful pearls. It is definitely worth coming. .",
          "Let me talk about transportation first. It is very convenient to get to the Robert Wynn Pearl Museum. They provide free pick-up. Call to make an appointment. They can pick up from the hotel. If you spend there, you will be sent back to the hotel for free. If you are already in Papeete It is more convenient to walk to the city center. It provides services in Chinese. If you want to know, you will give a detailed explanation. Needless to say, the quality of pearls is good, mainly because you believe in this brand. It's an eye-opener to see the world's largest round black pearl. The dazzling array of jewels there will make you want to take home."

Highlights of the exhibits include rare collections of paintings and calligraphy, sculptures, ancient canoes and historical artifacts",

There are many stone statues, many pictures and some handicrafts, and some replicas of cultural relics left over from the past. Almost an hour or two is enough to visit here."

          "The beaches of Boracay are vast, with fine sand, and have the finest beaches in the world. Of course, it is really sunny when visiting during the day. It is recommended to watch the most beautiful sunset in the evening.\n\nTo say that Boracay has the finest, softest, whitest, and most beautiful beaches, it is Friday Beach. It is located at the end of the S1 area of White Beach and is named after the \"Friday Hotel\" located there. The locals call it \"Powder Sand\". When the fine white sand is hidden in the transparent and clear water, it forms a milky powder. Swimming and playing on the shore are like walking on the cow's milk lake, and come to the beach to pile sand. , Dui Castle can use your artistic imagination or you can lie down under the coconut grove beach, enjoy the sea and sky, blue sea and blue sky, or stroll on the beautiful and tranquil white sand beach and watch the sunset, which is beautiful.\n\nHow to get there: Friday Beach is not far to the west of Willy\u2019s Key, and it is connected to the white sand beach. If you have good physical strength, you are advised to walk west from the white sand beach, passing Friday Beach, and then to the west is Dingweed Beach , And further west is the West Bay Hotel.\n\nRecommended item: sailboat. You can go out to sea at any time, but it is most recommended at sunset. The afterglow of the setting sun dyes the entire sea red, and rides on a swaying sailboat to let the sea breeze slowly blow. You can wash away the fatigue of the whole day with just one trip."

          "I wouldn't go out of my way for bats but the area of the caves is near the best and most secluded beach on the island , (Iligigan) for this reason you need to go . but tricycles may not make it the entire way so be prepared with comfy shoes",
          "This is a very interesting tourist attraction and it is definitely worth taking a risk in your life. . . . It is full of adrenaline impulse, I really like the rich flora and fauna in this cave. It's great to see the bat sleeping upside down. It really enriches my knowledge here. During your arduous journey to the island, you will clearly see hundreds of bats hanging up and down on the trees beside the cave. This is a cool scene. The water here is very good. We are snorkeling nearby. There is no doubt that it is worth seeing here.",
          "The bat cave is not far from Puka Beach. There are various cave bats, flying foxes, fruit bats, etc. in the cave. If you aspire to be a naturalist or cave explorer, you can hire a local guide to take you through jungle trails to find these caves. At sunset, groups of bats fly out of the cave to hunt for food. The scene can be said to be quite spectacular. But if you want to go to the bat cave to find out, you need to endure the strong smell in the cave. To get to the bat cave, you need to cross the jungle path and climb down the steep wall. Usually tourists will hire a local guide who knows the structure of the cave very well and it will be easier to follow along. Go down to the bottom of the cave and continue to go deep, and you will find dense bats hanging on the cave wall above your head. Because the light in the cave is dark, you need to use a flashlight to see the bats clearly",
          "The bat cave is also a natural cave with a very dangerous environment. The deep location here is also very important. The number of bats is very large, and the temperature inside is quite similar. There are also many tourists visiting here.",
          "There are more than 2.5 million bats living in this scenic spot. Every night at 6:30 in the evening, they fly out in groups to find food. The scene is very dark and crushed. The main food of these bats is fruit. The reason why the durian output of Dabao is so good. More than half is due to the spread of pollination by these bats, so locals say that without bats, there would be no durian."

After taking the subway to HARBORLAND Station, it takes about 20 minutes to walk to Kobe Port. Looking back afterwards, walking from Mina To Motomachi will be closer. On the way there is a super-large OUTLET that forgot its name. Interested friends can go shopping. When you enter the Kobe Port area, the first thing you see is PORT TOWER. The tower under the curtain of night, under the radiance of the lights, presents the noble tones of red and gold. If you are a photography enthusiast, this is definitely a good place to fight monsters and level up. The mosaic square on the opposite side of PORT TOWER is also brightly lit, and it seems to be competing with the red-gold port tower in brilliant colors. Generally speaking, I feel that it is the best time to visit Kobe Port after nightfall, especially Port Tower. The noble and mysterious characteristics shown by the light at night should not be observed in the morning."

It is called the black sand beach, naturally because the sand is black, but the black sand here is completely different from the black sand that can be seen on the beaches of Taiwan. The sand quality is relatively fine, only the surface of the sand is black. There is still golden sand underneath. The hinterland of the entire beach is not large (maybe at high tide), next to it is the fishing boat berth, not far from Tanjung Rhu Beach, but the beauty index is very different. To be honest, you can leave more time for Tanjung Rhu Beach!",
          "Some beautiful scenery will be unforgettable if you only see it once in your life, and some places will feel a bit regretful if you don\u2019t go there in person. Even so, the black beach of Vic is in my heart. This place will not be a walk-and-go tour. It takes a long time to plan, and the natural beauty will not disappoint you. Although as a young person, the current way of traveling generally chooses to travel freely, so as not to be uncomfortable with the group tour, or to receive time constraints, but I feel that it is better to travel with a group if you come here for the first time. Otherwise, it will take a long time to find the way, or it will be better to find acquaintances or friends in the local area to play with. Otherwise, even if you do enough strategy, you will be confused, especially if you have been living in Asia and don\u2019t know the local situation. It is better to be cautious. It is generally more suitable for a group tour to take about 15 days. I personally feel that when I come to this place, I can learn about the situation through a tour guide and see some natural landscapes. The black sand beach is rarely seen in China, so the first time I saw it is beautiful, although it is black sand, it looks very clean and does not feel dirty, so it is very comfortable to play, watching the sea view here, I feel It is even more spectacular, and it makes people feel comfortable in an instant that makes people forget all their troubles. We have a good itinerary for the group tour this time, but I feel that the meal is still not delicious, and may not be suitable for the taste of local dishes, so I often go hungry at night or go back to the store to buy some snacks, so it is recommended to match the food Those who have taste requirements can suggest to bring some food to fill their stomachs when necessary, but this attraction is really worth visiting.",
          "For the 2018 Malaysia New Year's Eve, the last stop is the black sand beach near Tanjung Lu Beach in Langkawi. It is sparsely populated and there are few commercial facilities, so it is not a popular check-in spot. On the contrary, many local children are playing happily. The black sand beach originated from the movement of the earth's crust hundreds of millions of years ago, which allowed countless creatures that had no time to escape into fossils under the ground, and gradually washed away and weathered into a black sand beach over time, forming today's unique landform!"

There are too many people in the peak season, the experience is relatively discounted. The ropeway is waiting for an hour on the ropeway, and waiting for the high-speed rail bus for another hour. It is recommended to go up the mountain before 8:30 in the peak season. China-Brazil bus usually takes 20-30 minutes, but it is recommended to wait for 1 hour for the bus. Accommodation is recommended to stay at the mountain, cheap and convenient, not bad money can live in the mountain, the price of one night is more than my Wuyuan 2 nights accommodation + 1 day chartered car.

          "Niagara Falls International Rainbow Bridge (commonly known as Rainbow Bridge) is an arch bridge across the Niagara River Canyon. It spans 290 meters and connects New York State and Ontario, Canada. The rainbow bridge was designed by architect Richard Lee (Richard Lee), and it was opened on 1941 11 1.",
          "The spectacular scenery is definitely a must in life, but unfortunately the epidemic can not go again, regret.",
          "Oh, what a beautiful view, it's heartwarming, now the skills are gone.",
          "Rainbow Bridge, located in Niagara Falls, is the U. S. -Canada border bridge near \"American Falls\". Rainbow Bridge is named Rainbow, its own shape like rainbow only one side, the world is the same shape of many bridges; The rainbow formed by water mist is seen from Canada when the American waterfall is in a suitable climate and angle, which may be the reason for the name of Rainbow Bridge. If you are near a certain angle on a cruise ship and the sun and water mist are right, you can be lucky to see the double rainbow. I see the double rainbow. The rainbow is on the daily trains. The United States and Canada have separate checkpoints near their bridgeheads to check people and cars in transit. I flew from the US to Toronto, then to Niagara Falls, a few days later through Rainbow Bridge from Canada into the US, after visiting the USA Waterfall Park area, then Buffalo City... On the Canadian shore and the US shore to see Rainbow Bridge, the landscape is different; While watching the two shores on the rainbow bridge, the angles are different, the landscape is different naturally. I had walked one night, on the Canadian side, under the bridge pier of the bridge. It is different to see the bridge at night and the bridge in the day. And the closest view from the outside of the rainbow bridge, is to take the \"horn\" cruise, this is my favorite observation of the rainbow bridge journey. In fact, the scenery is not moving there, is moving, different angles. Life course, in different positions, different periods, the perception, the persistence is different. There may be some relative recognition of natural landscapes; but in human society, it is difficult to hope the same and similar; if we want harmony, we should strive for common ground in seeking common ground while preserving differences. In fact, I speak a little of ideas and thinking in most of the words I write. I am the first to be republican, and different. I think that many of the problems are caused by thinking and culture. The road to change cultural thinking is long. Human beings must have common points, including the life, human values, human freedom, human feelings in the common parts, and the national conditions, region, history, habits, no inevitable relationship. Some people say that there are commonalities and differences ... so it is not necessarily related to the national conditions, regional history and habits. When I say that human beings have some commonalities, I say these commonalities rather than characteristics. The universality of human beings and the happiness of human beings are not only in stressing differences but in striving for republicanism. The so-called republicanism is to seek common ground while preserving differences. The essence of seeking common ground and preserving differences is to hold tolerance for the \"different points\" that cannot be solved at a time; and to constructively maintain and expand the \"similar points\". Rainbow Bridge is essentially the same as other bridges, just because the two banks are artificially divided into two countries, thus becoming a border bridge. If there is no country apart, it is good to walk freely! For example, we have a love affair, both sides or one side presupposed that we can not cross the position. For example, Rainbow Bridge, they hope that the other party will come over, but they do not move, so will never meet on the bridge, never see some kind of scenery.",
          "Cross the Niagara River, connecting the United States and Maple Leaf, if you have both visas, you can go to the middle of the bridge and feel the scale of the first international waterfall in the world. If you are still so lucky, you can stand at the rainbow bridge and encounter the rainbow is not a dream."

It is suitable for driving by yourself or chartered car from Wuyuan County for about an hour. There is a mountain road in the middle. \ud83d\udd59Open time:07:30\u201417:30\ud83d\udcb0Ticket price: 60 yuan for a separate ticket. If you want to go to other scenic spots in Wuyuan, such as Jiangwan, Likeng, Qikou, Sixi Yancun, it is recommended to buy a set ticket, more than 200 yuan in five days. It is more cost-effective. \ud83c\udf1f Highlight Feature: Wolong Valley is a primitive eco-gorge landscape, known as \"Jiangnan First Canyon.\" There are a group of waterfalls in the alpine valley, connected by pools, tree-lined and beautiful. The stone monument at the entrance of the scenic spot is the inscription of Mr. Jin Yong. Wolong Valley is about four kilometers long. It can take more than 100 meters from the ropeway to the second highest \"Bailong Waterfall\" in China, and then take a photo down the mountain. \ud83d\udcccSmall Tips: It is recommended to take the ropeway up the mountain, the ticket price is 50 yuan. Down the canyon, the peak turns back to the water, and the scenery changes. This saves energy and time, and the whole journey is over in two hours.

The hotel park at the door is very good. Every few minutes, police cars and staff will be around the lake. The whole circle of the lake is about 75 kilometers down, all of the lake is covered with plastic running, bike paths, if it is summer, must try the bike around the lake.

The east bank is the same as the south bank. The scenery is the best, and many supporting facilities are good. Once you enter the door, you will bite the tourist's dining and dining center about 3km away. There will be a RV hotel about 7 or 8km. Entering the North Bank, the point will also have a very high-end hotel star room to choose from. And the lake is beginning to have flowing water without ice. Walking west across the North Bank, this road is too exciting, you can see the wind and snow, the amount of snow can be reached in a day, 20-30CM high. But it's good that even in the off-season, there are lots of hard-working snow shovels every day, so tourists don't have to worry about the ground. It's really hard to go to the south bank. We may have caught up with the weather that day, almost 2m sight of the road can not see, is covered by falling snow, like the fog, very exaggerated, can only slowly move at about 10km per hour. This wind and snowy weather has probably gone about 10km. Finally, there is about 10km away from the south gate. Suddenly it rained and cleared, there is no danger, the scenery is particularly charming. Overall this park is a level of 4a but definitely has reached the level of service of 5a, especially with a lot of options in terms of accommodation, we stayed in a hotel apartment, which belongs to the park. The price is very and very clean. The service attitude of all the park staff was very good and exceptionally enthusiastic whether you are doing nucleic acid or eating, parking or buying tickets.

          "[Scenery] As far as water is concerned, there is no one in the world\n[Fun] It depends on God's help or not, the sun is the best\n[Value for money] is definitely a must in life\nThe Jiuzhaigou Scenic Area is in the shape of a Y. Due to the earthquake in previous years, the right side of the Y branch only opens to the sea of five flowers. So now the main attractions in the scenic area are 3 waterfalls, Pearl Beach Waterfall (this waterfall has Monkey King and Zhu Bajie who will take a photo with you), Nuorilang Waterfall, Shuzheng Waterfall, these 3 waterfalls are all worth going, get a raincoat or a jacket , The water will splash you all over. The gate of Jiuzhaigou is more than 2500 above sea level, and the Changhai scenic spot is very big. The altitude is the highest in Jiuzhaigou scenic area, more than 3100. It is best to go in snow, snow + sun is the best, you can photograph the perfect combination of snowy mountains and sea, if not If the sun is out, you can't see the snow-capped mountains and it's foggy. Wucai Pool is now surrounded by nets. I can\u2019t walk to the pool to watch it. I can only take pictures on it. Unfortunately, it also needs sunlight. The lake will change color. Rainbows are not available. If there is no sunlight, the lake water It's just blue. The Wuhuahai scenic spot is a must visit. It takes more than an hour to take a photo around the lake. The bottom of the lake is very deep, but it is crystal clear, and the sun is the best, and it can send a clear reflection. The scenic spots in Jinghai most need sunlight, otherwise, you won't be able to take any reflections on cloudy days. Rhino Sea, Tiger Sea, Reed Sea, Ssangyong Sea, and Bonsai Beach scenic spots are actually average. It may also be because the previous scenic spots are too beautiful. Looking at these, I am a little tired. Jingjiao bus drove directly to Nuorilang Central Station from the door, accepting the scheduling arrangement, randomly went to a Y-shaped fork, or got off at Changhai, walked to Wucaichi and took the bus back to Nuorilang Central Station, or under Wuhuahai Car, walk to Jinghai and take the bus back to Nuorilang Central Station. There are 2 restaurants in Nuorilang Central Station. One is to order food on the machine and then go to the counter to get it. They are all noodles or rice, which cost more than 30 yuan and 40 yuan; the other is a buffet restaurant, 60 yuan per person, with a little food. Do more and be full. There is free boiled water outside. If you bring instant noodles, you can go for soaking, but there are a lot of people in line, and there is a 20 yuan guest meal outside. It is best to arrive at the scenic spot before 7:45 in the morning, the sooner the better, otherwise the queue is dead. Tickets for scenic spots in peak season can only be used for one day, and off-season can be used for 2 days, and the fare for the scenery is still to be paid every day. There are minibuses in it, and each person costs more than 200 yuan. The collectors in the scenic area are now not allowed to live. The hotels outside the scenic area are similar to those below 4 stars. The facilities are average. The five-star Hilton and Sheraton are good. There is also a five-star hotel in Jiuzhaigou County. The supermarkets outside the scenic area are generally more expensive, and the price of the non-staple food supermarket next to Longzhou Hotel is not bad. Don't worry about breakfast, there are small restaurants next to it. Outside the scenic area is a taxi that costs 10 yuan. There is a long-distance passenger terminal next to the gate of the scenic area, where you can buy tickets, and buses from Jiuzhaigou County can pass here to the airport or Chengdu. If you charter a car from Jiuzhaigou to Huanglong Airport, it takes about 200. If Huanglong Scenic Area comes to Jiuzhaigou Scenic Area, there are few cars, because cars are concentrated in Jiuzhaigou Scenic Area.",
          "The scenic spot opens at 7:30. The sightseeing bus will basically go to Changhai, the highest point on the left side of the Y line. There is a sightseeing platform. You can walk along the plank road to the smallest colorful pool of Haizi. The color is dark blue, because the bottom is deep. Colored water plants, reflections will make the mirror overlap, and the photos will not look good. There are 2 scenic spots on the left line. You can take a sightseeing bus from Wuhuachi to Wuhuahai, the highest point on the right line. On cloudy days, the scenery of Wuhuahai is not very beautiful, and the mountains on the front are under construction. Desperate. Next, you can take a car from Wuhuahai to Pearl Beach, but it is recommended to walk past the plank road and pass by the blue and blue Jinling Sea (really more beautiful than the colorful pool), large and small running water, thick moss, senior pine, etc. The scenery is small but really beautiful. If you walk, you will first go to the flat slope of the high pearl beach. The water flows through the travertine rock hole. The water droplets that pop out are like pearls. The plank road crosses, and then you will walk to the gentle slope of the pearl beach. It is recommended to wear bright clothes Take pictures, because the water droplets are not three-dimensional when they are taken. There is a kind of snowy light, which will make your face very dark; don't miss the Pearl Beach waterfall when you go down. The old version of Journey to the West is a scenic spot. The waterfall is also very good during the rainy season. Spectacular, the coat will be wet by the splashing waterfall. Then walk 1.7km to the Jinghai parking lot and get on the car to Jinghai, the fourth big sea, in the absence of wind, sunshine and colorful forest, the reflection of the prototype and the reflection makes the mood much calmer. Take a car to the center of Nuorilang, the only place to eat in the scenic spot, and walk more than 400 meters to Mizoguchi to reach the iconic attraction Nuorilang Waterfall, which means majestic. The 2017 earthquake was severely damaged and has been restored by manual intervention. It\u2019s great. The widest waterfall in the country, the roar of the falling water, and the splash of the waterfall hit your heart all the time. Next is the sea group of Shuzhenggou, Rhino Sea, Tiger Sea, Princess Sea, Shuzheng Waterfall, Shuzheng Group Sea, Wolong Sea, Sparkling Sea, Shuanglonghai Waterfall, Reed Beach, Bonsai Beach, every sea has Beautiful legend. If there is only one day, you can choose a few Haizi at the bus stop to stroll around. If it takes 2 days, you can walk the plank road in 2 days. It is recommended to take the road plank road in the outer circle because it is high and the mountains surround the emerald sea and waterfalls. , The bushes are all big shots at random. I personally suggest that Shuanglonghai Waterfall must go, because the restoration of the sea of sparks makes the water flow of Shuanglonghai Waterfall larger, because there are more layers of travertine rocks, the waterfalls are more beautiful, and the most important thing is that there are fewer people and you can sit here for a long time. , Watching the waterfall quietly, listening to the sound of water, it was really comfortable. The Rhino Sea is similar to the Tiger Sea. The reed beach is very long, and it feels almost 2km long, but the sea like a jade belt flows quietly among the large tracts of reeds. I really want to lie down on the spot and have a beautiful sleep. The last stop is Zharu Temple, you can see if you go to worship or visit according to your personal beliefs. \u201cSpring flowers in spring, flowing water in summer, colorful forest in autumn, and white snow in winter.\u201d Although the scenery of Jiuzhaigou is beautiful all year round, it still takes some luck and opportunity to see the most beautiful scenery, and the scenery of Jiuzhaigou cannot be completely taken from photos and videos alone. It's really worth it to appreciate it.",
          "Jiuzhaigou Scenic Area, you can queue up directly for the set tickets bought in Trip.com and brush your ID card. Many people will line up for the sightseeing car. First go to the long sea attractions on the left, sunshine and water fog, blue sky and white clouds, blue sea\u5b50, colored forests, visit the five-color pool on the way, and then take the car to the five-color sea scenic spot on the right. Then you play all the way to Nuorilang Falls, then continue to visit Shuzheng Falls and so on, and visit 4:30 to Mizoguchi. Needless to say, the beauty of Jiuzhaigou is a third time to play, but unfortunately this time it is a bit early, the red leaf level has not yet appeared, every time you see there will be surprises.",
          "I came to Jiuzhai in mid-March, the whole tour route of Jiuzhai is Y-shaped, from the entrance by sightseeing bus 20 minutes to reach the Norilang transit station, then according to the day tour schedule first to Changhai or first to Wuhuahai. Personally, Wuhuahai is better looking. Other places may be the season is wrong, there are drop-offs, the whole tour time is more than 6 hours is enough. It is best to bring lunch by yourself, otherwise it will be more delayed to go to the restaurant near the transfer station at noon."

Artificial islands house pavilions and palaces which are great for walking around and then having a rest in the shade. To the right of the lakes is the plains area showing the manchurian heritage of the Qing dynasty. This area if just grassland, but at the end there are some Mongolian yurts and a tall pagoda. Then there is the mountain area which takes up most of the space of the resort. This area is sometimes closed (late winter and spring), but the tour bus that races around the mountains is definitely worth it. There are many areas in which you can get off, with the highlight probably being the view of the 'mini potala palace' from the wall.

          "Departing from Tianjin at 7:00 in the morning, it took 4 hours to arrive at Chengde and went directly to Puning Temple without checking in. The first stop of the Dragon Boat Festival trip to Chengde. I didn't know anything about Chengde and I was surprised to see the architecture of Tibetan Buddhism. Because the people of Beijing are prohibited from leaving Beijing due to the epidemic, there are very few tourists in Chengde this Dragon Boat Festival. Puning Temple parking lot is very empty, parking fee is 10 yuan per time, unlimited time. Then go to the main entrance and show the Hebei Health Code, temperature measurement, ID card registration, and then enter the door after five passes and six generals \ud83d\ude02. The weather in Chengde during the Dragon Boat Festival was good. It was cloudy and not hot when we went, but the photo effects were not good. The temples in Chengde are built on the mountain, so the whole tour process is like climbing a mountain, but you can see while climbing, so it's not as boring and hard as climbing. Puning Temple should be the most open temple in Chengde. Each temple has many different Buddha statues, and there is also a very big Buddha, which is very remarkable. As long as there is a staircase, climb up to the top. There is a rest area. It looks like a small house surrounded by Buddhist scripture flags. There are stone tables and stools inside. There is also a Puyou Temple next to the temple. It is very small and only remains. The staff at the door will explain to you what it was like before it was burned down. It is very enthusiastic. Along the exit, not far is the parking lot. The route is well planned. Puning Temple is very worth visiting.",

Because it is very scarce, I don\u2019t think you can miss it if you like natural and cultural landscapes. The tickets are not expensive and the price/performance ratio is high. Because I brought a baby, I can only choose the cable car. The cable car is a bit worthless and low cost performance. I suggest that adults without children and the elderly can climb on their own. In fact, they are not very high, and they will go up in half an hour."

After purchasing the ticket, you will enter by car and walk along the roads of the scenic spot. Immortal Tower, Yiran Pavilion, Wuling Jinshan, Qingliang Boundary Monument,... The main peak of Wuling Mountain is 2118 meters, with strong wind and low temperature. Fortunately, I brought my own cotton clothes. There are also cotton coats for rent on the top platform.

Tickets for the scenic area are 108 yuan, half price for 60-65 years old, and free for people over 65. There is no fare for self-driving cars. It took more than 4 hours to walk in and stop from the south gate to the north gate. Maybe it can save time on weekdays. It takes 1,500 meters to walk to Longmen Waterfall, so I gave up because I didn't have enough time and physical strength. 80 yuan by cable car. The roads in the scenic area are cement pavement and the pavement is narrow, so you need to drive carefully. The west gate of the scenic spot cannot be entered by car, only on foot.

Plus \u00a5500 if you want to buy the plastic cup. I ate at the Three Broomsticks. I stayed half of the day at Hogsmeade. The castle ride was an absolute fun! I did it twice!

The transportation is convenient, and the circulation in the museum is well planned. It is the largest indoor aquarium in the world. The best part is that you don\u2019t need to go to the Hokkaido Museum to see the King Penguins. I am very happy to see the group of penguins. It turns out that they sleep standing up. They are so cute! There is also a sink at the exit (I think the Japanese are very attentive). After the children wash their hands, they can touch the stingray experience. The son is very happy; the mall next to it happened to have a discount, and the mother was very happy to buy it. I would like to go again next time because there is still a boat to tour Osaka that hasn't been taken yet."

Toyotomi Hideyoshi intended the castle to become the center of a new, unified Japan under Toyotomi rule. It was the largest castle at the time.However, a few years after Hideyoshi's death, Tokugawa troops attacked and destroyed the castle and terminated the Toyotomi lineage in 1615. Osaka Castle was rebuilt by Tokugawa Hidetada in the 1620s, but its main castle tower was struck by lightening in 1665 and burnt down.It was not until 1931 that the present ferro-concrete reconstruction of the castle tower was built. During the war it miraculously survived the city wide air raids. Major repair works gave the castle new glamor in 1997. The castle tower is now entirely modern on the inside and even features an elevator for easier accessibility. It houses an informative museum about the castle's history and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.",

          "In 1671, the French royal family ordered the construction of a shelter for the poor, the Hospice de la Vieille Charit\u00e9 (Hospice de la Vieille Charit\u00e9). The main purpose was to build a shelter for the poor and sick immigrants on the streets of Marseille. This is a very strange selfish attitude, not out of compassion, because the nobles asked these poor people not to leave the asylum at will, they don't like to see these poor people running around in Marseille. The center of the ancient relief house has an artistic courtyard, the Museum of Archeology (Mus\u00e9e d''Arch\u00e9ologie) and the Museum of African, Oceanic & American Indian Art (Museum of African, Oceanic & American Indian Art), which is very eye-catching. In 1671, the nobles of Marseille established a refuge for the \"poor and beggars\". This was the ancient almshouse in the old city of Marseille. The main body of the hospice is divided into two parts: the Pierre hospital and the dome church. It was designed by Pierre, the author of the Palace of Versailles, the queen architect of the French King Louis XIV. It has the style of the Italian Renaissance but is simpler simple. After several renovations, the current almshouse has become a comprehensive cultural center including the Mediterranean Archaeological Museum, the Egyptian Antiquities Museum, the African Art Museum, and the French Academy of Social Sciences. It is said that the completion of the ancient almshouse was not because of the great mercy of the nobles of Marseille, but because of their peculiar mentality similar to \"cleanliness\". They were fed up with the poor people who had been squandering the streets of Marseille for a long time. So they simply built this refuge and forced them to live in it, and they were not allowed to leave at will. Unexpectedly, hundreds of years later, this building would come in handy.",
          "The building of the almshouse itself is very simple, and there are hardly too many tedious designs, but there are many exhibition halls inside the almshouse, which mainly display exhibits from Africa and ancient Rome, which are not rich enough, but very special. If you do not enter the exhibition hall, you do not need to buy tickets."

          "The Marseille Railway Station is located in the Saint Charles area. It is not tall in appearance. Because it is built on a high slope, it takes two sections of pedestrian elevators from the station to the subway platform, one of which is very long. The facilities in the station have been modernized, and your life and services are complete. Trains enter and leave the station in a terminal style, with each platform lined up, and there is no need to go up and down the tunnel when changing.",
          "Many soldiers patrol the railway station. I don't know if it is a special arrangement during the European Cup or it is usually done. There is a place to store luggage in the train station, which is very cheap. The large locker costs 9.5 Euro a day and can hold 3 large luggage. We deposited it. I saw many fans also come here to store their luggage. Then you can play lightly. Remember to check if the train departure time is too late, and the luggage area will open at around 8:30 in the morning, so don't delay the trip.",
          "Marseille Railway Station is also a very important place leading to many places of travel. This small station is constantly large. The car show has transportation to other cities in France. This railway station is also a historic gate with many buildings. They are all short.",
          "Marseille train station has high-speed rail to Paris, which is relatively convenient. It\u2019s two subway stops away from the old port in the city center. It takes more than 20 minutes to walk. The law and order here may not be very good, so pay attention to safety.",

Today this stunning wooden bridge is the gateway to the narrow streets of the old town. It's a lovely symbol of Hoi An's inclusive history and makes a great Instagram shot too!",
          "The western extremity of Tran Phu is marked by a small arched bridge of red-painted wood, popularly known as the Japanese Covered Bridge, which has been adopted as Hoi An\u2019s emblem.It was known to exist in the mid-sixteenth century, and has subsequently been reconstructed several times to the same simple design. According to local folklore, the bridge was erected after Japan suffered a series of violent earthquakes which geomancers attributed to a restless monster lying with its head in India, tail in Japan and heart in Hoi An. The only remedy was to build a bridge whose stone piles would drive a metaphorical sword through the beast\u2019s heart and fortuitously provide a handy passage across the muddy creek.",

Ride the cable car to the castle, with a wide view, and the round-trip fare is very fair. The cable car has been in operation since the Middle Ages, when it was driven by steam. The cable car, which had been changed to electric drive, took us to the top of the mountain in less than 2 minutes. Standing at the highest point of Buda, looking around, the Danube is right in front of you, and Pest on the other side of the chain bridge is quiet and charming. As I remember, the side with the castle is Buda. In just three days, I have been deeply attracted by this beautiful and magnificent city. If you plan to travel to Europe, remember to include Hungary in the list of cities. It will not disappoint.",
          "Budapest Castle Hill is the earliest old city in Budapest. It is like a huge museum showing the history of Hungary's development from ancient times to the present. Standing on the Castle Hill overlooking the city, Budapest is full of weather, picturesque scenery, visual impact, the wide Danube River passes through the city, the Baroque buildings on both sides of the city and the majestic castle complement each other, and a majestic imperial atmosphere is oncoming.",
          "More scenic spots worth seeing, the scenery is still very good.",
          "Castle Hill is located on the Buda side of Budapest, Hungary. The famous Fisherman's Bastion, Majiaszhai Church and Buda Palace are all located on the Castle Hill. If you are going to the Buda Palace on Castle Hill, you can consider using a cable car or elevator. If you are going to Fisherman\u2019s Bastion, you can take a direct bus.",
          "Budapest Castle Hill\nBudapest Castle Hill is the earliest old city in Budapest. It is like a huge museum, showing the history of Budapest\u2019s urban development and the past of the Hungarian nation.\nThe topography of Castle Hill is dangerous. It sits on a hill 167 meters above sea level on the bank of the Danube. Choosing such a place to build the castle was obviously out of the need for war defense.\nThe most famous attractions in Castle Hill are:\nThe Holy Trinity Square is the central square of Castle Hill. The Trinity Memorial Column, also known as the \"Plague Column\", was erected by the residents of the old city in the 18th century to commemorate the elimination of the Black Death.\nMatthias Church (Santa Maria Church, Church of the Assumption), it has 700 years of history.\nFisherman\u2019s Bastion, the white Fisherman\u2019s Bastion is next to the Matthias Church. This is a neo-Gothic building built on the foundation of the original medieval city wall at the beginning of the last century. The 7 minaret-like bunkers represent the 7 tribes of the early Magya people in Hungary. Standing on the city of Fisherman\u2019s Bastion, the Danube River flows quietly from underfoot. The parliament building on the opposite bank, various buildings along the river, the lush Margit Island and the distant mountains have a panoramic view. The mood suddenly became clear. No wonder it is recognized that the Fisherman\u2019s Bastion adds a lot to the castle\u2019s landscape.\nThe bronze statue between the Matthias Church and the Fisherman\u2019s Castle is the coronation in 1000 AD, the founder of the Hungarian state, and the first Hungarian King Saint Istavan I.\nThe southern end of Castle Hill is completely occupied by the grand ancient palace. As long as you see the bullet-scarred and crumbling old palace gate that has not been repaired so far, you can imagine the historical ordeal that this famous European palace has experienced.\nCastle Hill is free and open all day. The tour time takes about 2-3 hours. It is also a great place to watch the view of Budapest and the Danube, and the night view is also very beautiful."

          "I like oil painting, and I dreamed that the world through the frame would one day become my home. After growing up, I still like oil painting, but I feel that the world in oil painting is not real. But this time... When I set foot on this small village far from home, the first thing I saw was a large area of distinct but soft green. I was amazed at the supernatural workmanship of nature, the world in the original oil painting actually exists. \ufffc\ufffc\ufffcHow to start from Amsterdam, Netherlands: You can buy a round-trip pass for 39 euros at the Amsterdam train station, including train transfer and bus, and there are super cute maps of other cities. On the way to the train, you can enjoy the natural scenery outside the window, but remember, there is a transfer in the middle, you need to change a train to Steenwijk in Zwolle The place name of the station is displayed on the train, which can be easily checked. When you get to Steenwijk, you can find the No. 70 bus stop (you can take the pass with the pass) when you get out of the train station. Then you will get off at Dominee TO Hylkemaweg, Giethoorn in Giethoorn. The whole journey takes more than 2 hours. . Among them, bus No. 70 returns from Giethoorn to Steenwijk at the latest at 19:09 from Monday to Friday, and at 18:06 on weekends. So friends can refer to the schedule to have fun. It is added that the earliest bus No. 70 from Steenwijk to Giethoorn is at 06:57 from Monday to Friday, 08:27 on Saturday, and 09:26 on Sunday. Xiaotian\u2019s travel suggestions: 1. For the trip to Giethoorn, Xiaotian recommends that everyone go for a day trip without accommodation and return on the same day. Giethoorn is not big. If the schedule is tight, there is no need to spend extra time and money. But if you want to spend a holiday here, it\u2019s not a good idea to experience a local B&B. For self-service travelers who are not restricted by their itinerary, it is recommended to spend 2-3 days on vacation here. Rent a cabin and a small wooden boat in the camping area, or rent a bicycle to stroll around the boulevards, and enjoy the joy of life in the closest way to nature. 2. The camera equipment must be fully charged. The beautiful scenery here is indeed picturesque. You can call yourself a picture scroll when you take a picture. You can choose some bright clothes to match the beautiful scenery. 3. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know how to swim. Giethoorn\u2019s climate is pleasant, and the boats are steady and slow. Please enjoy the spring lake here. Of course, if you suffer from seasickness, it is always safe to prepare medicine. The scenery like an oil painting, the simple and enthusiastic residents, away from the hustle and bustle of Taoyuan, welcome you to enjoy a beautiful holiday here! (Best travel time from April to October)",
          "[Scenery] The beauty of Giethoorn is not only the beauty of nature, but also the beauty of humanistic care during the trip! After we got off the train, the driver who took the bus to the village made me appreciate the enthusiasm of pointing; when I entered the village entrance Van de Jonge restaurant and hotel, I once again felt at home, without looking at the passport, but directly into the afternoon. During the tea time, I arranged a dinner menu for us; I woke up early and went shopping in the village, and the boys and girls on bicycles heard good morning sounds in Dutch and English. I also heard Chinese \"Good morning\"! [Fun] One day in Taoyuan, the world has been thousands of years. Learn about the architectural features here, the special thatch, and the nearly lost craftsmanship! [Value for money] You won\u2019t miss it!",
          "It is far away from the hustle and bustle, pure and peaceful, completely free from outside intrusion.",
          "Giethoorn, a classic windmill water village around Amsterdam. It takes 40 minutes to get there directly by bus, and you can use the Amsterdam wide area ticket, which is suitable for a day round trip from the airport. Windmill lake view, blue sky and white clouds, plus black and white cows, very strong Dutch flavor. Recommended."

          "one of the best waterfalls in yunnan province , worth visiting",
          "Good view, nice waterfall. Nothing like Giuzhaiguo but good for local travels.",
          "Jiang Ji/Travel Notes: Luoping Jiulong Waterfall Jiulong Waterfall is located in Luoping County, Qujing. I went again because there was no water when I went last time, so I didn't think it was. I just spent a day in the farmland. This time, after inquiring about the situation, I finally got my wish. I have seen a lot of waterfalls. To put it bluntly, it is not a big spectacle. The main reason is the drop and scale. Of course, it is very important whether it is the rainy season. If you encounter the feat of a foreign waterfall that went against the sky a few days ago, it will be hard to come by. The advantage of Jiulong Waterfall is that it is crowded. We enter from the west gate of the scenic spot, which is regarded as the back door. There are very few tourists entering from the west gate. The advantage of the back door is not that it does not require money, but that it is located at a high position, so the biggest advantage of visiting the waterfalls in reverse is that there is no need to climb. The greenery with bamboo as the main vegetation along the way is refreshing, and some terraced fields add a humanistic atmosphere, which becomes a landscape of mountains, rocks and water, green plants and blue sky. When you walk down the stairs, you will encounter several stalls selling water and corn and sweet potatoes. Water is the price of the scenic spot, and corn is the standard of the vegetable market. If you want to come to the countryside, the things grown in the land are worthless. There are also a few wild tour guides, the local women who are more articulate, will come forward to pull business, but will not entangle. The waterfalls here are beautiful. Where there is a large amount of water, a diffused mist will form. The small amount of water is like a crystal-clear jade bead curtain. The green between the mountains and the water is more dense. With the fresh air, it really is a place worth visiting. There is a tea pavilion shop on the mountainside. The wooden structure is quite simple, but the seller is not friendly. A cup of tea with paper cups that can\u2019t tell what it is costs 15 yuan. We chose to sit near the waterfall. Next, the right to drink tea and smoke when buying tickets again. The water quality I visited this time is said to be quite good. When there is plenty of rain, the mud and sand will be washed down, and the water will become turbid, but there is still a gap with the clearer waterfall I have seen, but it is much more unique because of its richness. , It's not a concealment. When you reach the bottom section, you can enjoy the scenery of the multi-cascade waterfall. The waterfall surface is also wide. It is difficult to take a panoramic view with a mobile phone, and it can be said to be a little spectacular. Then go out to the main entrance of the scenic spot, which is the east gate. There is a group of welcoming waterfalls at the entrance, which looks like a large-scale bonsai, very elegant. Of course, it is nothing new to enter from the west gate to here. There is a large parking lot and a souvenir shop at the front entrance. We found a black car to ride back to the west gate. The fare of ten yuan per person is very fair. After all, the uphill road for several kilometers is not so easy. Then we stayed at Longyu B&B near Ximen and ate chicken soup and freshly picked vegetables. It was very delicious. We also drank some small roasts made by the owner. The room was clean and affordable, and we had a relaxing day.",
          "The Jiulong Waterfalls in Luoping, Yunnan is one of the six most beautiful waterfalls in my country recommended by the magazine \"Chinese National Geographic\", 22 kilometers away from Luoping County. Due to the special geological structure and the millennia of erosion by the water flow, ten-level waterfalls with different shapes and heights have been formed here. The largest one is 112 meters wide and 56 meters high. It is magnificent and spectacular. The first waterfall in Kowloon. The Jiulong Waterfalls group has its own unique viewing characteristics due to its numerous waterfalls and dense scenic spots. The scenery is continuous throughout the year. It is known as the \"Nine Dragons Ten Waterfalls, a unique in the South\".",
          "The Jiulong Waterfalls group is particularly powerful, because the many waterfalls are gathered together, so there is a roar of ten thousand horses, which makes many tourists who come to it amazed. This life is proud of seeing such waterfalls."

          "The Tanjiang Karst Cave is the most famous cave in the Vang Vieng area. In the early 19th century, it was used as a bunker against Yunnan Muslims and a resting place for Yunnan robbers. With nearly 200 stairs going up, it leads to the main cave entrance. The cave itself is not the most attractive place. In the main cave, which leads to the opening of the limestone wall, you can enjoy the gorgeous and charming scenery of the river valley and the panoramic view of Vang Vieng town in the distance, especially when the sun is setting. , The scenery is really charming. This cave is completely dry, there is no river inside, and the stalactites are illuminated with colorful lights, which is very mysterious. Except for the simple lighting street lamps, there are almost no traces of artificial carvings in the caves. These limestone walls of various shapes are the visual enjoyment that nature bestows on mankind. Although the temperature outside is extremely high, the inside of the cave is very cool and refreshing. The scene here is still very suitable for taking pictures. The karst landforms created these caves, which can satisfy everyone's desire for exploration. Although there are lights inside, prepare a large flashlight, which has a novel feeling. See the world freely",
          "Tickets are not expensive and only 10,000 kip. There are no other tourists. It is located in the mountains and forests. It is very original and the original flavor that we all like very much. The cave is in the forest on the mountainside. The entrance of the cave is very small and locked with an iron gate. The ticket seller in the scenic spot accompanied us all the way to climb the mountain and opened the door, and turned on the simple lights in the cave. After a section of winding and deep entrance road, the front suddenly opened up and a cave appeared. In the hall, weird stalactites were presented in front of us. With the faint light, they climbed up through the hall. There was still a hall inside. The scenery was still good. Everyone took a closer look and left after taking pictures.",
          "Located on the west bank of the Nansong River, the Tanjiang Karst cave is the most prestigious cave in Vang Vieng. The pool in the cave is extremely clear and you can swim and play. Standing at the entrance of the cave, you can enjoy the panoramic view of Wanrong and the fields, which makes people feel refreshed.",
          "Wanrong is a standard karst landform, so there are many karst caves, most of which have not been developed and utilized. The two or three more famous karst caves such as Tanjiang have simple basic supporting facilities, so the original ecology is also very well maintained. Play cave exploration game.",
          "Good walkWalked on the famous red orange bridge. Dipped in the cold water spring. Excellent for passing time. Not far from the town. A typical hangout for starters in vangvieng."

          "I have long heard that Vang Vieng is known as the most relaxing place in Laos. The scenery here is beautiful, with limestone hills, verdant rivers, and dense vegetation, much like the scenery of Guilin. You can drift in the water, you can swim and dive, you can play hot air balloons in the sky, and explore caves in the underground. I don\u2019t want to play anymore. There are many bars, cafes and restaurants by the river, and you can order a pot of tea or coffee, blowing the river breeze. Looking at the scenery, you can sit all day.",
          "When I went to Wan Vieng to play, I specially tried the local hot air balloon project. Because it is a project opened by a Chinese, the order is a bit cheaper. But it costs more than $80 per person. I went to the meeting point early the next morning. The staff were all Chinese, very enthusiastic and helped to take pictures. The hot-air balloon pilots are also Chinese and very enthusiastic. The whole trip was very pleasant.",
          "The hot air balloon in Vang Vieng is probably the cheapest in the world. The price is now about US$90 per person and it takes about 45 minutes. There are two hot air balloons a day, one at around 6 in the morning and one at four or five in the afternoon.\nI didn't buy any tickets for the afternoon that day, and I chose the one for the next morning.\nThe hot air balloon company is run by Chinese, and the main staff are also Chinese.\nThe price includes hotel pick-up and drop-off.\nIt is still very spectacular to see the panoramic view of Vang Vieng in the air in the early morning, very beautiful. The shock is beyond words.",
          "It is probably the cheapest hot air balloon ride in the world. After we arrived in Vang Vieng, we looked for a hot air balloon agent on the street. Finally found a shop of 87.75 dollars. Pick us up early the next morning. The team are all Chinese, so they are very enthusiastic when they see it, and they help take pictures. The captain of the hot air balloon is also a Chinese national, and he also introduced the content. Great.",
          "This is probably the cheapest and best value hot air balloon I have ever taken. I went there many years ago. At that time, it seemed that there was only 60 dollars, and the transfer was included. Pickup trucks will pick you up at the hotel and return to the hotel after the end. Think about $60 for a good meal in Shanghai is not enough, you can play a hot air balloon comfortably in Vang Vieng. Wanrong is really a paradise for outdoor sports! The hot air balloon company seemed to be opened by a Chinese in Wanrong. It's a coincidence. It seems that all the hot air balloons I have traveled all over the world were driven by Chinese. The difference is that the price of this store is only a fraction of that of Australia and the United States, which is more than a digit less. The hot air balloon is unpowered and depends on the wind. The time I sat in it seemed to be very windy, flying high, and far away. As a result, it took a lot of effort to land and finally returned to the ground. Picture 4 shows a group of ground crews descending in a hot air balloon. A car followed the hot air balloon on the ground throughout the journey. The hot air balloon pilot will use the walkie-talkie to communicate with the ground where to land. Hot air balloons are not suitable for people who are afraid of heights. The time I sat, there was a person in the basket who was not flying high at first, but after flying high, his feet became weak and he finally squatted in the basket."

Every May, all kinds of flowers start to bloom, and the entire Furano hills are like a vast sea of purple flowers, which makes people dizzy, and has become a shooting location for many Japanese advertisements. Farm Tomita, the most colorful and colorful, is most often seen in Hokkaido landscape postcards. The farm is divided into five colorful flower areas. The colorful flower field at the rear is a representative landscape, like a cosmic super luxurious tapestry stretching out to the side of the flower field. Pine forest. See the world freely",
          "I spent 3 days and 2 nights in Furano on this flower viewing trip. The beautiful scenery, the spotless streets, and the courteous locals felt really great. I live in the hotel in front of Furano Station. It is extremely convenient to travel. The jr line, lavender bus, and taxi waiting point are all nearby. Farm Tomita, Machiei Lavender Garden, Hinode Park, New Furano Prince Hotel are all worth visiting. Although Furano is relatively remote, there are Fukuzushi, Sensari Japanese cuisine, and barbecue restaurants near the station, which can satisfy a few days of dinner."

It is said that it was a scene created for filming in the past. It really looks like a fairy tale world. It feels like there should be little people living in the cabin. In fact, there are shops in the cabin. When the sky gets dark, it is the most beautiful time here.\nI regretted the chartered car with a tour group. This is the last stop of the itinerary. Because the journey is relatively long, the tour time arranged by the travel agency is very tight. Half an hour includes the time to go to the bathroom, but the bathroom is still a bit far away and there is a queue, so Basically, it came out after taking some photos after turning around. If you have time, I recommend you come by car and take photos and drink coffee here.\nJust don't miss the time of the shuttle bus. The traffic here is not very convenient. Missing the shuttle bus is more troublesome.",

Nakafurano is closer to the mountains and the terrain is more undulating. The lavender garden is on the slopes of Mount Hokushin.

          "After playing at Farm Tomita, if you want to return to Furano, you can only go to Nakafurano Station to take a JR or a bus. During this time, you will pass by North Star Mountain. Futian Farm is a flat piece of land, while Beixing Mountain is mainly a hillside. There is a cable car next to it, the most primitive kind of cable car. But the slope is not big, just walk around. The key is that the flowers on the slope of the season we went to have been harvested, and only a piece of cosmos and sage were planted at the foot of the mountain. In fact, if it is not on the way, there is no need to make a special trip to Beixing Mountain after watching Tomita Farm. The flowers are almost the same.",
          "Farm Tomita is so popular that there are too many people to take good photos. Relatively speaking, it is very relaxed, there are not many people, and there are cable cars going up and down. It is comfortable, and if time is good, it will also be a large purple area. It can take the effect of Farm Tomita."

You can see the city view from the room, but not the view of the waterfall. The location of the hotel is good, you can see the Sky Wheel within a five or six minutes walk, which is a lively place. Walking all the way, walking and enjoying, I feel like Las Vegas-like western excitement, take the opportunity to appreciate the western culture a little; then walk, follow the crowd, you can reach the scenic spots to watch the Great Falls. From the Canadian side of this viewing point, you can see the \"American Falls\" on the opposite side, and the \"Horseshoe Falls\" can also be seen from a distance. The waterfall fireworks show at night is very beautiful. I did not book a hotel breakfast. There are many restaurants around the hotel, and you can find one for breakfast outside. It is suitable for traveling alone or in groups, and also suitable for bringing children or the elderly. However, extra beds are not allowed in standard rooms. For specific policies, please refer to the hotel policy page when booking with Ctrip. There is a parking lot, but you don\u2019t need a car if you only travel around the waterfall. Theoretically speaking, it is usually impossible to see the waterfall directly from the rooms of this hotel, because there are other hotels in front of the hotel that are closer to the waterfall, so they are blocked and cannot directly watch the waterfall. However, under normal circumstances, most travelers will not book hotels and rooms with direct views of the Great Falls because of cost-effectiveness.",

          "The Niagara Ferris Wheel is said to be the best place to view Niagara Falls, but I still prefer to stand on the edge of the waterfall to enjoy it. It is really refreshing to feel the flying stream down three thousand feet and the water droplets on the face.",
          "The Ferris wheel is worth a ride, the price is super high, and the scenery is very beautiful. Compared with the cruise, it is a different flavor. I was in a small situation when I picked up the ticket. I was not satisfied. Ctrip did not mark it to remind me. Foreigner Shan doesn't admit it and wants you to print it out.",
          "After seeing more of the Ferris Wheel, I feel that it is similar. The difference is that on the Ferris wheel, you can see different scenery. Also, with whom you are with different moods, you will naturally feel different. In fact, at the end of watching the flowers, there is always love. This place is very lively. It feels to combine the landscape with various western entertainment and commercial elements, and it blends well. In a trance, I think it is a combination of Las Vegas and Cancun. At high places, sometimes it seems like on a mountain. You are at the top of the mountain where I will collapse, twisting your slender waist, charming. I once again picked pearls on the riverbed where you ruptured, and then suddenly exerted force to make the tide. If the beauty and the king, fight with the sword, kill! Happiness is dripping to death; or hand in hand, return to the dream bed of the year, condense, and wait for the collapse to come..."

You can take a boat from the American side, a two-story cruise, and a second-story platform for taking pictures and feeling the waterfall. Visitors will wear simple raincoats. But even so, when you are close to the Horseshoe Falls and feel the waterfall up close, you will still get wet by the water mist and splashes of the waterfall, and electronic products such as cameras should be specially protected. Getting wet by the waterfall is also a characteristic ceremony of cruise, just like getting wet during the Songkran Festival. It\u2019s a joy to get close to the waterfall.",

Old drums , stone cravings , praying arenas are quite interesting. The place is so calm and peaceful. The buddha with that smiling face is amazing sculpture - damn positivity \ud83d\ude4f... Thousand buddha cave - was interesting and good we can find many creativity at its best inside and can see the old well( mouth not so big) near the exit area. City gold temple with 3000 years old tree and fossil trees, longetivity stone that are really a natural gem , with kind people to explain each and everything . The pools with centre spray attractions are really good to see. Jiagnan gaint buddha - very most of the prayers done, people come here and worship for wellness , health and wealth. Many Monks are seen - which makes ones to admire their discipline. Thousand hand bodhisattva , golden buddha in the pool surrounded with golden lotus , mountain cravings depicting the scenario's are really impressive. Statue on top of the dragon fish and another statue on top of an animal made with pool entrance inside like a cave is way beyond words to describe .Overall the best experience in my life , will never forget and will never hesitate to go again.. will always recommend for one to have their inner peace & love #dafotemple #buddha #xinchang",

Address, Domplatz Frankfurt, Hesse Germany. You can take the U-Bahn to Hauptwache station. Tips: You can browse the nearby area on foot. Frankfurt Cathedral and the Roman Forum are not far from the Main River Cruise Terminal. Walk all the way, watch the scenery, take a few photos as you like, or sit down and have a drink. If there is not much free space in the tourist season, fortunately, there are still. At the time of the conference, although many hotels were full, but fortunately it was not the peak tourist season, so I could calm down. When he was calm, he was not close or far away on the banks of the Main River, opening his eyes lazily. When it was more calm, it was night. When I was calmer, I was in a dream. Although it is Goethe's hometown, he does not feel poetic, only the restlessness of the world and the silence after the prosperity is gone. When the fingers fell, the other bank seemed to be closed; and the horse of dream, as if traveling through time and space, was trapped between the Rhine and Danube at the beginning of the century, and the Romans happened to build the Great Wall connecting the two rivers. This shore and the other shore are actually nothing more than a river, one evil and one dream. After all, it's nothing more than passing on their genes, their will, or their dreams."

          "Frankfurt\u2019s Old Town Hall, das Rathaus, is a landmark of Frankfurt and a symbol of old Frankfurt. It is located on the west side of the Roman Forum in Frankfurt, also known as the Romans, der R\u00f6mer. The Old City Hall is composed of three gothic buildings with gable walls, and its roof is in a stepped herringbone shape, which is quite distinctive. One of the three buildings is called Rema. On the second floor of Rema there is the Emperor\u2019s Hall, Kaisersaal, where the coronation ceremony of the Holy Roman Emperor was held. Frankfurt is famous for its modern industrial, financial, and air transportation centers, and the Roman Forum, where the old city hall is located, is a symbol of old Frankfurt. Strolling in the Roman Forum, walking through the quaint old buildings, and smelling the scent of coffee, you gradually become immersed in the relaxed elegance. Unknowingly, I have walked to the River Main. It is not as gorgeous as London\u2019s River Thames, nor as romantic as Paris\u2019s Seine River, but there is a lot of mixed tranquility, like a long whistle, penetrating the desolation in the open field , Bringing the fun of cooling off in childhood and summer. It is said that these buildings of Rema are the products of the 15th century; in fact, most of the buildings were rebuilt after World War II. Human beings always cry out to cherish, and despise and mutilate them. Always push yourself to the corner, desperate and bruised. Rema, Rema, what a nice term. Rema, tell me, is it difficult to keep the bottom line? Can you not lie to yourself?",
          "The gate of the old city hall opened in a very inconspicuous courtyard on the fork road, and there was only a self-service ticket vending machine. Ascended a circular staircase and came to the interior of the city hall. The walls on both sides are covered with portraits of successive kings.",
          "[Fun] Actually, if you are not particularly familiar with history, you really don't understand it, but the color of the house is really good, especially if you have a blue sky in the background. Because there is a small church next to it\u26ea\ufe0f, you can hear the bell ringing when it is punctual."

          "Located in southern Australia, where the summer weather is not hot, long pants and short-sleeved shirts are fine. If it is cloudy, even wearing a long-sleeved shirt is not hot. Melbourne has two airports, and international flights all take off and land at airports closer to the city. There is a train station in the city, and trains to the suburbs of Melbourne or to Sydney pass through here. The urban transportation is convenient. Public transportation has trams, urban trains, buses but no subway. Buses to the suburbs depart at a large interval, almost every half an hour, which is not as convenient as Beijing. Taxis are generally only found at fixed taxi stands, and generally cannot be stopped on the street. It is very convenient to buy a local bus card (myki card), which can be bought at the airport. I live on Swanston Street in the city center, not far from Federation Square, Flinders Railway Station, Chinatown, and St. Paul\u2019s Church, all within walking distance. When I went to catch up with the Australian Open, I was lying on Federation Square basking in the sun, drinking beer and watching the live broadcast on the big screen, with a large group of people lying around. There are several stations around the hotel where I live, and it is very convenient to go out by bus. It's very convenient to travel for free in Melbourne's CBD area. There are not as many public toilets as in Beijing. The city center is crowded and crowded. At night, people who are homeless and drunk start to show up on the streets, yelling, blowing and beating. If no one is around, you will feel that Beijing is still safe. The surrounding towns are very quiet, you can take the light rail to the town to experience the daily life of the locals. There are many Italian restaurants on Lygon Street. I feel that a Ferrari-car-themed restaurant called Caf\u00e9 Corretto is worth recommending. It is cost-effective and crowded, especially on weekends. Diagonally opposite brunetti is a famous local dessert shop, you can try it. I tried several ice creams there. They were generally sweet and tasted average. You can eat something else next time. Brightonbeach is actually a large beach, divided into three parts. The most well-known section has a lot of people. I think the middle brightonbeach is better, but the traffic is not very convenient. There is no light rail train and you can only take a bus. You should go to the Great Ocean Road. I will give a detailed description in the review of the Great Ocean Road. In short, Melbourne is still very good, the environment is good, the locals live a comfortable life, the city is livable, and it is better than Sydney where I later went. The reason why I haven't visited all the places in Melbourne is probably because I think I will go there in the future.",

See the world freely",

The steep limestone cliffs tower above the roaring sea, and the waves and tides that have shook and eroded the soft rocks for thousands of years have finally created these priceless natural treasures. The twelve Apostle Rocks are the essence of Australia's natural landscape. Standing on the rock cliffs, the monsoon winds from the Antarctic Circle, the waves are hitting the beach under the cliffs, and the waves are hitting the shore. The huge rock blocks along the coast, cut by sea and rain, and eroded by strong winds, have, after thousands or tens of thousands of years, become stony columns of different shapes, shimmering in the sea and blue sky.

It began when Liu Bei Huiling was built in the first year of the Emperor Zhaolie in the Sui and Han Dynasty, and built the temple in the same time. About 500 years ago and after the Northern and Southern Dynasties, Wuhou Temple moved from the \"short city\" of Chengdu to build the temple in Huiling and Han Dynasty, which continued into the Ming Dynasty.

The museum's live explanation is usually only 1 hour. If you see Bikego on Trip.com, you can talk about two and a half hours, so you place an order. Only we two traveled that day, the instructor Xie Dong is a local, she took us slowly forward, full of pride and enthusiasm to filial piety, every site, every artifacts are so rare, detailed to impeccable! Before went to Samsungdui, was shocked by the ancient Shu civilization, there are many questions: is a sacrificial pit used once or several times? Samsungdui and Jinsha site what is the connection? Why some cultural relics are so delicate to the modern civilization can not reach the point? What does the different hairstyles mean for the bronze man? Wait...Xie Dong gave very patient explanations and was extremely professional. For those who enjoy deep travel, it is a good choice to go with Bikego. Overall great, fun, fun, cost-effective,",

          "Such an impressive sight to see. Also, I enjoyed the small statue where you can throw coins into for good luck.",
          "This place is a WoW. it has the greatest vibes ever. the venue around it looks even more attractive. the entrance is kinda expensive though. 40 to enter pagoda and 25 to climb it is a total rip off but you know what? You are gonna love every minute of it. don\u2019t forget the fountain show the north side of the landmark. it is number one in Asia. we missed it but we definitely will be back for it. you should definitely try the rooftop of the mall across from the South Gate. maybe a couple of drinks at Blue Frogs ;) make sure you will check out all the streets around that area.",
          "A very calming, peaceful place of worship, and the pagoda itself is huge and fascinating! The park is massive, and there are three parts to it. The outer park is free, and full of restaurants and gift stores. The inner part is \u00a540 and has beautiful temples and forests to wander around. The pagoda itself is an extra \u00a525, and you can climb to the top, seven stories up! Absolutely lush views from the top!Be respectful at the temples - don\u2019t take photos of the Buddha statues, and be mindful that people come and light incense and give offerings to the Buddha at these temples. Giant Wild Goose Pagoda is well worth a visit - peaceful, beautiful place, and easy to get to via the metro system too!"

The transportation to the Snow World is very convenient, well equipped, the big turn down the middle and advanced snow lanes is a challenge for skiers, due to the winter Olympics, there are many professional athletes training here now, due to their too large movements, Snow trails make it more difficult for amateurs.

First of all, the environmental hygiene and staff quality are very good. For example, the staff passing by will tell you how to wear clothes and how Wearing shoes can help you solve all problems. The length and slope of the ski resort are very suitable, but the advanced trail is more exciting.

          "Went on 31 December 2020. Absolutely amazing.  It's breathtakingly beautiful. Reviews can't capture how stunning it is, so go see for yourself. Some tips for first timers:- Make sure to go before sunset so see everything in daylight and all lit up. It truly is worth it seeing it in daylight too. It was dark out at around 4.30pm. - Getting there early might save you from standing for a 2hour wait in a queue for one of the big slides. - It's cold. Exposed hair froze, eyelashes froze, nostril hair froze. If you dress properly, and prepare for it, the cold isn't too bad. Take heating patches with and stick 'em in your pockets. Your hands will frikken BURN from cold if you keep taking gloves off to handle your phone. These things saved us! They also help keep your phone from dying in your pocket. - Didi doesn't come through to the entrance for pick ups. It's about a 30min queue outside for a taxi at night. Be prepared with a drop off location for the the driver if you can't speak Mandarin because...-  It's colder outside the park than in it (wind). If your phones battery hasn't failed you by this point, this is where it will just drop. Mine went from 39\u2105 to dead in like 4 min trying to get the hotels address.",
          "absolutely beautiful and highly recommend!! no photos will ever do the justice of how breathtaking it really is. Frozen meets Alice in Wonderland. I was in awe the entire time! it\u2019s best to go before sunset and watch it turn into a lit up winter wonderland at night. We ate at the dumpling restaurant and the food was great",
          "I went on the day opening 23 December 2020, go before sunset to see it in the day and night, it's so worth it! Got a discount for being so early! Lot's to do, food inside, one quick walk around takes around 40 minutes, but taking your time and enjoying everything you could spend the best part of half a day. It's so worth it. You can buy tickets on the door.",

It consists of four identical classical palace facades, surrounded by rococo interiors in an octagonal courtyard; in the center of the square is a huge equestrian statue of King Frederick V, founder of Amalienborg.\n\nAmalienborg was originally built for four noble families. However, when the Christiansborg Palace was burned down on February 26, 1794, the royal family purchased these palaces and moved into this palace. Over the years, various monarchs and their families lived in four different palaces.",

They wore bearskin hats, black uniforms, gold buttons, blue trousers, white ribbons, and big boots on their ankles, and white straps crossed in front of them, swords and shackles (ancient fashion bullets, ammunition) hanging behind them, living like the \"iron soldier\" in Andersen's fairy tale. They stood at a fixed point, with their guns, at times standing in front of the spire, the eight-rowed, red sign; at other times, with their shoulder-fired guns and their hands crossed, and with their feet in front, the two guards walked face to face or side by side from one end of the gate to the other.

The hole became a lake called L\u00f6grinn and Leginum (locative).

It was originally known as Coal Peninsula and was set aside for military fortifications to guard the entrance to Vancouver harbour.

If you get on the suspension bridge, you will temporarily stop moving forward. That's because some tourists want to stop to take pictures themselves, or very kindly, pause for other people to take pictures. My personal suggestion is that there are more tourists when you go, and you may take pictures on the return journey. With fewer people, the difficulty of taking pictures will be reduced. 3. There is also a small suspension bridge inside. Unlike the landscape underneath the suspension bridge at Ruyuan, there are trees underneath it, which is less crowded and more wild. 4. Temperate rainforest, with lush woods and high oxygen content, walking in it, layers of green, high and low mountains, there is a feeling of a small forest adventure.",

Great value! It's too inconvenient to park nearby and the parking fee is extremely expensive, the only regret.",
          "One of the purposes of spring trips to San Francisco is of course to eat. The unique history and culture of San Francisco has created a unique atmosphere for eating. From high-end Michelin-starred restaurants to night market roadside stalls, from fine French cuisine to the cravings of barbecue. Whatever you like, this is the place to meet. Follow my food map today and step out and see where your favorite dishes are in San Francisco! The six-block, small Japanese town, is a collection of the most classic Japanese food outlets and a one-stop, tasty service experience that will make you enjoy your meal and your time. As one of the oldest Japanese cities in the United States, it is a veritable food paradise, ramen, udon, sushi, you can think of all can eat here. The Mission is one of the most integrated and diverse neighborhoods in town, and along Valencia, Mission and 24th Street you pass by many Mexican fast food restaurants and restaurants to try authentic South American style. Recommended are Gracias Madre, a vegetarian-oriented Mexican restaurant; Taqueria Canc\u00fan, pushing super burrito; and Tacolicious, a popular Mexican-flavored restaurant. Of course, apart from the three mentioned above, each has its own characteristics, which is worth trying! Vegetarians It's not easy to go out and eat anywhere with vegetarians, but in San Francisco, a city that loves meat and vegetables, you can find a lot of vegetarian options no matter where you are in the neighborhood. The smell of home in Richmond and Sunset is a sure way to go to Chinatown when you think of it, but Chinatown is not the only place to go. If you go to Richmond and Sunset, you'll find many delicious authentic Chinese restaurants. The status of the brunch at Union Square is not to be underestimated in San Francisco. Every weekend, people give up sleeping late for the unlimited mimosa, coffee and brunch. If you want to experience the local brunch charm, Union Square in the city center is the perfect place to be. Friendship tip: It's best to be at the restaurant by 9 o'clock, after all, the more people you see in the queue at dinner, the more happy you will be. Who said there can be no romance in the trip? If you're worried about a romantic candlelit dinner, bring your dear TA, to Mount Noble or the Views Restaurant on the coast, and take the city's starlight and panoramic view. In the evening, the two can also walk along the river pier, to keep the sunset romantic time. The most hidden street food Marina and SOMA have become the most popular food in San Francisco in recent years, making it difficult to find the best food in the dining car. Fortunately, you can go to Fort Mason, where the Off the Grid dining car assembly will definitely let you find your favorite. There is also hidden under the high-speed SoMa street dining car food park, one by one to eat, let you eat.",
          "Union Square is a must-see attraction in San Francisco. Strictly speaking, there is nothing to visit, just a square, just passing by, there is no need to spend time visiting. This is also the transportation center of San Francisco, and most lines can be transferred here. The surrounding business is very developed, and shopping here is also a good choice. For example, the Tiffany store next to it is a whole building, and Macy's is also nearby. There are also many high-end hotels next to it. Because of the convenient transportation, the traffic is also very large."

It reminds me a little of Epcot because you get to visit Africa and Asia, but it\u2019s also very visually stunning with the Tree of Life and the jungle-like atmosphere. Now with the added World of Avatar, it\u2019s easily the best Park at Disney, until they open Star Wars at Hollywood Studios!",

          "Not as crowded as the Magic Kingdom! This Disney World theme park is pretty awesome with my favorite  being the Pandora section which is themed after the movie Avator. It was beautiful both day and night! There were also some very well performed shows and live entertainment. Make reservations to restaurants a couple of days ahead using the Disney World app! You can also order food when you get hungry at any of the parks on your mobile device for some restaurants, also made easy using the Disney World app. It has been a lifesaver!"

Don't miss this one!There are lunch/dinner packages that will get you reserved seats for the show. Otherwise you'll want to get to the amphitheater at least 60 minutes prior to the show starting. They've added some pre-show entertainment to keep the crowd from losing their minds with boredom until the show starts.Once its over, take your time getting out.

The home of a number of major museums, Ueno Park is also celebrated in spring for its\u00a0cherry blossoms\u00a0and\u00a0hanami.In recent times the park and its attractions have drawn over ten million visitors a year, making it Japan's most popular city park.",

It is recommended to arrive in the afternoon (because the sun is too strong at noon \u2600\ufe0f when the weather is good), then watch the sunset \ud83c\udf04, stay until \ud83c\udf03 at night, be sure to see the night view and then go down the mountain \ud83c\udfdc\ufe0f Oh, the scenery during the day and night is different. -\u2763\ufe0f When buying tickets \ud83c\udfab, you can buy the sightseeing car \ud83d\ude8c together. Friends with energy suggest walking \ud83d\udeb6\u200d\u2640\ufe0f up the mountain. All the way to the mountain \ud83d\udcc8 can see the scenery below the mountain, one side is the mountain \u26f0\ufe0f one side is the view \ud83c\udfde. Although it is uphill, it is very smooth, there is a need to push a baby carriage or an old wheelchair \ud83e\uddbd, absolutely no problem \ud83d\udc4c.

          "I have been to Sanya many times. The deer has not punched back. This time I stayed at the hotel next to me and came to see the sunset in the fall. The scenic tickets are divided into two types with cable car and hike up, as long as the legs are not so inconvenient, it is recommended to go up is really not very far. Start climbing up the mountain at 4 o'clock, just saw the sunset at 5:30, really beautiful, much better than Sanya Bay, after all, in a high angle of overlook, definitely worth going to the place. I used to feel that there was no fun to travel on a sunny day, this small attraction has a little surprise, there is a panoramic view of Sanya along the way, especially the other parts of Phoenix Island are difficult to see, although the statue is not interesting, but the sunset is really worth it.",
          "After going to the first market to eat the perfect smell of Linjie seafood, take a ten-minute car to Sanya's landmark Luhuitou. The Luhuitou mountain top is simply beautiful to enjoy the sunset and night view of Sanya, especially after a short walk up the mountain. It is located in the seaside hills around the sea on three sides of Sanya City, the main peak is 275.1 meters above sea level. Here the corners of the mountains and the waves reflect, standing on the mountain overlooking the vast sea, overlooking the rolling mountains, the panoramic view of Sanya City is extremely magnificent. The highest sculpture of the entire island of Hainan, built according to the beautiful love legend, has become the city sculpture of Sanya, which is also named Lucheng. Adult tickets alone 32 yuan, including 48 yuan of battery car. It is relatively safe to buy at least 20 minutes in advance. Purchase on the spot online can not enter the park immediately. There is a special network ticket exchange window. The process is very smooth. No. 54 bus can reach the parking lot of the scenic spot. The last bus departure time is 9:30 in the evening. No. 26 bus can reach the scenic gate, the last bus is early. If the physical strength is better or even average, it is recommended to walk up the mountain, not high, although some of the individual curves are a bit of a big slope, but the whole climb process is not difficult, even if not often exercise people can easily reach. Moreover, there are many observation pavilions half way, it is well worth stopping to enjoy the scenery of Sanya from different angles. The most recommended tour time is the evening mountain, so you can enjoy the sunset, did not eat, bring your own food and eat at the top, waiting for the city lights to light up, and you can enjoy the night of Sanya at the top. But there is nothing to play at the top, from sunset to light, few people can bear this loneliness, hahahaha. There are several shops on the top of the mountain that sell food. The price is the price of the scenic spot, but it is also ok, roasted sausage is very good. The Deer Head Park has a nice view and I think it is worth going to.",
          "This year's Spring Festival in Sanya, the first day is to Luhuitou Scenic Area, there are good legends, love stories, standing at the highest peak, saw Dadong Bay, Sanya Bay, Phoenix Island far away can also see Haitang Bay, if your God, remember to go to Luhuitou!",
          "Very cost-effective attractions, parking is very convenient, parking fee is only 5 yuan. Trip.com's ticket + battery car is only 52 yuan for adults, the scenic spot scan code to buy tickets is 57 yuan, the elderly over 60 years old and under 18 years old are only 40 yuan, fast ticket issuance, no need to change tickets, use ID card and QR code can enter the park. Unless you are very physically strong, the battery car must be done, and the climb on the hill is very tired. After getting off the battery car and entering the scenic spot, the mimosa in the flower bed at the foot of the mountain is very cute. Touching the leaves with your hand and closing it is quite fun. It is recommended to follow the road to the observation deck, when you go down the mountain, you can walk down the steps, and go directly to the door after coming down, very convenient. The scenery at the top is beautiful, there are two props for pictures, the scenery is good, the overall is awesome, fun, fun, cost-effective, there are attractions where old people and children will not be tired, have fun."

          "We wanted to spend at least one of the days during our vacation swimming in a clear sea. So we took a speed boat from the Xidao Wharf, which was 95 RMB for a round-trip, and spent the whole day there. This place was really beautiful, water was turquoise and so clear, we could see mackerel snooping around the pier. I would say it was the cleanest beach around Sanya, with sand basically of sea-ground corals and shells. It was gloomy and rainy on the opposite shore when we enjoyed sun baths on the West island beaches. After that we took a ride (35 RMB for a round-trip) along the seaside with a destination point at the little adjacent island. The whole place basically is more than just a touristic spot, it has its own history. During the WWII it was a military base of Chinese, then Japanese troops, so you would find catacombs and fortifications during your journey around the island. Most of them are closed nowadays, but we found an opened one right under the hill with a golden bull on the top I'd highly recommend this place if you got tired of the overcrowded beaches in Sanya. It's really worth visiting",

          "This attraction, I said two o'clock. First, \ud83c\udf34\ud83c\udf34\ud83c\udf34 Not buying the project on Wuzhizhou, it's better to go directly to West Island, the scenery is the same, the facilities are different, Wuzhizhou is a private business, the commercial routine is very deep, deliberately pressure the customer to cause the queue, let you buy the big V to skip the queue, in fact, the reason for the queue is not many people, But there is only one ticket gate, \ud83d\ude0e is not very funny! The fools are fooled, the smart people don't eat your set (there are detailed no-line guides below)! Compared with West Island, more than 2,000 original residents just let you know the local customs and habits, and you can rent a small motorcycle to play around the island! Second \ud83c\udf34\ud83c\udf34\ud83c\udf34 I said that the queue-free skills in Wuzhizhou are more than 30 kilometers from the city, which is not far, but the traffic is really a problem. If you report a day trip, you will waste 4 hours. Because the tour group has tasks to let you buy the island project, they will spend a lot of time explaining. And all the group departure times are the same, resulting in too many people landing at the same time, and the queue is serious. At this time, I suggest that everyone get up at 6 o'clock, take the earliest bus to Haitang Bay, such as No. 2 Road, and then take a taxi to the dock. The total cost is less than 20 yuan. The most important thing is that you arrive at the dock before 8 o'clock. Buying the ticket online the day before, picking up the ticket directly, landing on the island, guarantee not to queue, it is particularly cool! Even if you don't play, if you want to go to the island early, you will not have to queue at noon! If you want to play with projects, you can also play more (if you report a tour group, it must not be finished, because it takes a whole day to walk down the island to take a photo) West Island, you can get by bus, or rent a motorcycle in the city. It is also the earliest arrival. It is casual to play, unlike Wuzhizhou, which is not so particular!",
          "It's best to make sure you're expecting something from where you go. We take a little girl to the island and the children are still small to see the scenery on the island. Walking in the sand, not diving, not playing anything. The pure experience of the environment and people. The West Island has totally met our expectations. In addition to getting off the boat, we met the tour group. It took a long time to queue up and live in Sanya. Take a car from the city to the West Island Scenic Area. There are more than 40 Wuzhizhou in both directions of Yalong Bay. When you take a boat for 20 minutes and return to 3 o'clock in the afternoon, there will be more people waiting in line to spend time playing. It's better to watch the scenery, play the sand and step on the water. You can eat 88. You can also go to the fishing village to eat stalls."

It is famous for appearing in the painting \"Memory of Hometown\" by the travel American painter Chen Yifei.",
          "No disappointment, worth the trip, recommend a homestay hotel: smoked rain people, steamed white fish must taste.",
          "Shuangqiao is not actually two bridges, but a reflection of one bridge in the water, which looks like two bridges. Shuangqiao is also called the key bridge because when reflected in the water, it looks like a circle, more like a key used in ancient times, so it got a pen name. This bridge has actually attracted many famous Chinese painters and photographers to paint and take pictures here. Every year there are many artists who come here to take pictures. It can be said to be quite famous, and Shuangqiao really lives up to the expectations of the people. Simple and elegant",

Cars are not allowed in the town, and note that the town tocket is a once off entry so unless you arrange with accomodation to have multiple entries don\u2019t leave if you hope to return! Recommend wearing good walking shoes as the cobblestones are uneven and a day walking around is tiring. That said, it\u2019s highly worth the walk. Children under 1.4m free. Our favourite site within the town was the Tuisi Garden, but all the little shops of knick knacks were fun to browse - albeit some full of kitsch plastic toys that distract the kids. The boat ride was fun and our boat driver sang us some songs for a small fee. The three bridges that couples in times past cross when they marry was wistful, and the museum of wedding artefacts a fascinating window into earlier times. Overall could have spent quite a few days more here resting and lingering."

The weather is good, the scenery is good, the photographing technology is slag and it can be pleasing to the eye. The tips: Jinxi Ancient Town is really not many people, and it is very comfortable to find the flow of people. The small population is the small area of Xinfu Ancient Town, walking and resting all the way, and walking for three or four hours. The local products are oysters, sock bottom oysters, shrimp dry and fish dry, all the way. I feel that the price is also OK. The oyster is small 35 yuan a bag, the sock bottom oyster 5 yuan a bag, shrimp dry 80 yuan a catty, all OK. I found the fresh meat dumplings inside the ancient town for 3 yuan, but can't eat it.

Your hotel and people on the streets will try to sell you the tickets for significant markups, but the tickets can be purchased at the theatre entrance for 128RMB, so be aware of that - I recommend just renting a bike and driving out there on your own. Also, don\u2019t be concerned about which seat you get because many people get up and move to better seats (even down to VIP) once the show starts anyway so the seat numbers become essentially meaningless (however this might be different if the theatre is busier and there are less seats open, but I was there during winter and COVID so there was a lot of free space). All in all, I\u2019d the show is worth seeing. There is nothing particularly spectacular about it but it\u2019s still something to enjoy after you\u2019ve had your share of mountain views and West Street snacks.",

In Shili Gallery, there is a free shuttle bus to Yulong River scenic spot, which is transferred to the Gongnong Bridge. The Gongnong Bridge is the intersection of the two roads in the scenic spot, and it is also the best place for the scenery.

The blue moon lakes were very pretty too.",

There are several villages along the lake where one can stay, the ambiance is quite calm, and there are nice roads to walk around.",
          "The water in some areas is a vivid blue. It's better to spend at least two days, to explore most of the scenic area, which is huge.",
          "The proposition that the route from Lijiang to Wuhu seems a bit strange. Because there is a direct shuttle bus to the Wuhu Bus Station at Lijiang Bus Station, only there are fewer shuttle buses, about two trips a day. Ticket price is more than 71 yuan. There are also tourist buses that can be boarded from all over Lijiang's ancient city. The ticket price is 40 yuan. This is really cheap. But we are used to taking public transportation at passenger stations. We are afraid that if there is a problem in the later period, it is convenient to solve it. I checked it out. The journey from Lijiang to Ninglang is two-thirds of to Wuhu. The ticket price for this journey is 35 yuan. The last paragraph should be enough for a maximum of 20 yuan. And the shuttle bus to Ninglang will start at 8 am, and you can transfer to Wuhu early. But the situation is not so simple. Although Wuhu is a subordinate of Ninglang County, but, it may be that the local people go there directly less people, there is no special passenger shuttle, but they call the village minibus. To Wuhu cross the road, the fare to buy the end point 30 yuan. More troublesome is that this shuttle does not start at Ninglang Bus Station, but at the hospital near the bus station. The appearance of the bus does not have the spray mark of the village passenger transportation \uff5e The village passenger transportation we see in Guizhou and other places is obviously sprayed. This Ninglang country passenger car is really small, only 8 seats. Although tossing this, everyone just saved 6 yuan, but, in Ninglang County, the feeling of the Yi people, Ninglang Theatre, Museum, buildings, different from other ethnic groups. It's not that time is tight. I should stay here for one night. Is it originally a tour to stroll around and enjoy different exotic customs? [Smile] [Smile]. When I arrived at Wuhu Inn, the boss knew that we were coming by country coach, he said great. Estimated that foreign tourists who come to Wuhu are the only two of us to enter the scenic spot in this way! Haha",

          "Jiang Ji/Travel Notes of Lugu Lake\n\nThe vast majority of Lugu Lake belongs to the boundary of Lijiang, but like Erhai Lake, it is regarded as an independent scenic spot. It takes about three and a half hours to drive from Lijiang to Lugu Lake. Self-driving people traveling to Lijiang are usually caught by various people. Persuaded to charter, because the mountain road is not easy to drive. Is it really hard to drive? not necessarily. At least I went there properly. It is also a merchant's routine to come. After all, making money is very important.\nLugu Lake is indeed extraordinary.\nThe first is that the richness of the scenery of Lugu Lake is much greater than that of Erhai Lake, and the second is that the location of the viewing area is varied, so you can experience many different feelings of the same scenery. For example, Caohai, which is an area connected to the marriage bridge, thick and bright green grasses are distributed in large chunks on the lake surface, like a rich emerald, the water head is extremely plump, and the sky clouds match it. Suddenly the painting is full of oil painting style, and you can give praise without hesitation. What's not simple is that Caohai also incorporates folk customs like walking the marriage bridge. While enjoying the beautiful scenery, you can learn about some humanistic stories, and you can also extend it, because the scenic area is connected to the tribal villages of ethnic minorities, with a wide range and plenty of time. Really can walk around for a day. The sea of grass can be felt at close range, as if the freshness of the grass always surrounds it.\nThere are also magnificences that can be seen from a high place, such as the altar. You only need to climb up a little bit to see the place. Sitting in the pavilion or standing on the viewing platform, you can see the entire lake in your eyes. With the dazzling sunlight, you can see the brilliance of countless diamonds moving on the water surface. It is also far away from the mountains and the sky. Enjoy the cool breeze while chanting words, beautiful and beautiful. Of course, there are also scenic spots like Sunset Bay at Lover Beach, which are very peaceful and soothing. In addition to the crystal clear lake, there are ancient and vigorous trees, and there are boats of the Mosuo tribe. Throwing a stone in the lake, making an arc of ripples, is really beautiful. If Tiangongzuomei really has sunset clouds, sitting there for a few hours is absolutely likable. Many people like to go to Tibet to purify their souls. I think it is the same in Lugu Lake. Besides, she is not desolate but gentle. Lugu Lake and the Lige Peninsula have been developed well to meet the business demands of many travelers. There are inns with beautiful lakeside views, bars and cafes where you can relax, and many restaurants, which solve the problem of eating, lodging and traveling. The demand is still a place similar to a large lakeside park, so it is not too much to become a must-see. When I was drinking tea at a lakeside cafe there, I admired the blooming of watery flowers. It was very enchanting, and combined with that dish, I felt a lot of extra points. Lugu Lake is suitable for two days. After all, such a quiet and beautiful place is rare, and it is also spacious. There are many worth seeing along the lake, most of which don't need to spend money, except for the ticket to Lugu Lake. There are a lot of food there. I personally recommend wild mushroom soup hot pot, which tastes good and the price is right. As for living, the basic choices are homestays, and you get what you pay for, and you can choose according to your own disposition. I don't care much about those, after all, the scenery is so beautiful, it must be recommended."

Now it has become a plateau lake that maintains a certain water level. The mirror-like surface of the lake reflects the Yulong Snow Mountain. It has the unique atmosphere of plateau wetlands. It is recommended to visit with ample time. One day is enough to visit, mainly horse riding and walking along the plank road to feel the nature Scenery, you can go back and forth on the same day. Lashi Haijing District is better than it is close to the urban area of Lijiang, but the area that can be visited is not too large. The entire tour route is circular, mainly including the Wetland Museum, the Bird Watching Corridor, the Dongba Festival Museum, the Zodiac Avenue, Swan Lake, glass plank road, moon bay promenade, sea view wooden plank road and other attractions, the price of 30 yuan per person is not too expensive. For ecological protection, boating is now not allowed. Walking on the wooden plank road of the bird-watching promenade, there are wetland scenery on both sides, and some waterfowls swim around on the water from time to time, many of which are protected by the state. Walking into Lashihai, you are full of comfort and comfort. The calm and clear lake is like a large mirror, reflecting the blue sky and white clouds, and the breeze blows on the lake surface with circles. There are usually minivans to go to the ancient city of Lijiang, to Lashi Hainan or Haibei. Haibei is close to the island in the lake, while Hainan is the Lashihai resort. You must bargain a good price when you charter a car, usually around 100-200 yuan. The driver earns horseback riding fees. There are dozens of horse farms in Lashiha, and the price of play is not fixed. In fact, the route you choose is the same. No matter how much money you spend, you follow the general route. Don\u2019t imagine riding a horse on the grassland. Basically, you\u2019ll be walking the whole journey. Riding in the field is usually only around the lake. The price is about tens of yuan. Riding around the lake costs more than 100 yuan. Bargaining is necessary. Time is enough.",
          "I have been to Lashihai for five consecutive years. Every year I grow vegetables in a new clubhouse, take beautiful photos, ride horses, and eat local chicken hot pot. Not tired of it. Speaking of Yunyun Racecourse, friends who have been to Lijiang should be familiar with it. He was demolished and changed, but after the epidemic ended, he got better and better. Lashi Haimachang has always been a place to be scolded online, but no matter how online people complain, cloud business will always be the best. Good reputation, uniform price, good environment and good service. It can only be said that those tourists who are dragged to Lashihai on the street are greedy for petty gains. This situation can happen in any tourist city. On the National Day of 2020, I came to Yunyun Racecourse again for a vacation. Today, I played the happiest swing with three children, had the best small hot pot meal, and the ethnic minorities sang for fun. You can feel their smiles.

When the romantic writer Hugo traveled to Lake Lucerne, he wrote a beautiful verse, \"Elegant and quiet, the clear water gently pats the river bank, and the soft water flows under my feet...\".

It is the most famous sculpture in Lucerne and a symbol of Swiss loyalty and perseverance. This is to commemorate the French Revolution in 1792, when the mob attacked the Tuileries Palace in France, to protect the French King Louis XVI and Queen Mary, the monument built by 786 Swiss officers and guards who died, is intended to pray for world peace.

Sitting on the bench by the lake, the clouds are soothing, the lower eyebrows are the clear water, the swans on the lake are chasing and frolicking, the water birds are flying in groups, and the old trees with all leaves are beautifully Stretching out the branches, the setting sun gleams on the lake surface, as if to illuminate the late autumn with some warmth. In Lucerne, even if you don\u2019t go anywhere, just sitting by the lake, watching people come and going, teasing swans and waterbirds, listening to the lake and taking pictures of the shore is a kind of enjoyment."

          "The Titlis Snow Mountain in Engelberg is very beautiful. Although it arrives in summer, it is still far from the ski season, and there is still a lot of snow. The amount of snow in summer at an altitude of early 3000 is already very good. The world's first large revolving cable car is very interesting, the scenery on the way is also charming enough, and the small town at the foot of the mountain is also beautiful.

          "Titlis Snow Mountain Tour Guide\n\ud83d\udccdGeographical location: A famous scenic spot in the Alps, located in the small town of Engelberg in the south of Lucerne, Switzerland. The snow-capped mountains are about 3020 meters above sea level.\n\ud83d\ude84Means of transportation: Take the train from Lucerne to Engelberg and you can walk to the scenic area. Please check sbb.cn for specific train times.\n\ud83d\ude98The advantage of self-driving in Switzerland is that the scenery along the road is better, and the driving habits are the same. The disadvantage is that some routes need to pick up the car back and forth, and many scenic spots cannot enjoy discounts without the swiss pass.\n\ud83c\udd7f\ufe0fParking: Most outdoor parking lots are capped at CHF 5.\n\ud83c\udfabTicket: 92 francs, fold in half with swiss pass. There is a queue for ordering on site. We passed in the spring. The queue is very long. Basically, they bring their own ski equipment to the mountain.\n\ud83d\udcddTravel tips\n\ud83d\udd38The small town of Engelberg can reserve most of the day to go up and down the mountain.\n\ud83d\udd38The snow is thicker in spring, but sometimes the visibility is not high, and the chance of encountering cloudy days is higher. The situation on the snowy mountains is hard to say, it depends on luck. Remember to wear sunglasses. Snow blindness is easy on the mountain. In addition, sun protection needs to be in place.\n\ud83d\udd38The food at the foot of the mountain is definitely cheaper than on the mountain. After climbing to the top, it is also a good choice to go down and have a picnic at the foot of Titlis."

The canyon is not long, and everyone has enough time to take photos slowly.",
          "I read a lot of introductions and guides before going to the Antelope Valley. Some people say that the Lower Antelope Valley is more beautiful than the Upper Antelope Valley; some people say that you don\u2019t need to see the Lower Antelope Valley if you go to the Upper Antelope Valley (also say that you don\u2019t need to go to the Upper Antelope Valley if you go to Lower Antelope Valley) ; Some people say that the road down Antelope Canyon is steep. I have everything to say, making me undecided whether to go up the valley or down the valley, so I set aside half a day when planning the trip to Peggy. Practice has proved that this arrangement is really wise (boast yourself \ud83d\ude02). Our arrangement is like this. Before going to the United States, book Shanggu tickets on Ctrip.com. After going to Shanggu, drive to the Xiagu ticket office. Fortunately, the ticket office sells tickets for the day and the next day on site. Bought tickets for the next morning. To be honest, although Shanggu and Xiagu are the same landform, the landscapes are very beautiful but different. The Shanggu is flat. It takes time (good weather + noon) and a guide to help you spread sand to create the effect. ; Although the road is a little difficult to walk in the lower valley (compared to the upper valley), anyone who can walk can pass smoothly. The landscape of Xiagu is everywhere and the spiral stone walls are even more breathtaking. If you rarely have the opportunity to travel to Peggy again, it is recommended to go to the Antelope Canyon or the upper and lower valleys to visit, in order to pay for the trip. In your spare time touring the Upper and Lower Valleys, you can arrange to visit Horseshoe Bay, Lake Powell (must take a boat tour) and Grand Dam. The first picture was taken when I was out of the valley. When the tour was completed, there was only one passable space, but it was not difficult.",

The national park, which is very niche in name and strategy, was indeed one of the most surprising locations of our trip. Although the facilities are relatively simple or even rudimentary, it feels very simple and authentic. Here we are the first time to touch an otter up close. The best way to visit the national park with two lines for a full day is to take a boat. There are two lines to choose from. One is the Guinea Gorge and the Lingyang Gorge, which takes about two hours. One is the Rainbow Bridge line we chose, which takes about five hours. Just listen to the name, and of course choose the dreamy Rainbow Bridge. However, we recommend taking the boat at 7 o'clock in the morning for this line. In this case, it is the morning to reach the Rainbow Stone Bridge, and the reflection of the famous Rainbow Bridge can be photographed in calm waves. The blue pearl and red rocks are no exaggeration to say that Powell Lake is really blue like a gem, and the blue sky is as beautiful and unreal as in a documentary.

          "The Antelope Canyon is a famous slot-shaped canyon in the world, and it is a place where it's very popular. It must be visited by a local Indian guide, and the magical scenery is breathtaking \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb. It\u2019s really like what the tour guide said: When you enter the Antelope Canyon, no matter whether you take pictures with a SLR or the most common mobile phone, the results are super good!\n\nThere is a little risk in the process of going down the stairs to the inside of the Caixue, so be careful. It\u2019s not allowed to take pictures when going up and down the stairs. Be sure to grab the frozen metal handrails on both sides that look like popsicles (I regret not coming out with gloves). I regret wearing this wide-brimmed hat. The small corners of the inside are missing. I am often bumped and bumped \ud83d\ude30",
          "We visited Lower Antelope Canyon. A team of dozens of people separated into small teams of 10 and followed Navajo Indian guides into the colorful cave. These guides had no fixed salary and depended on tips. Therefore, it\u2019s best for everyone to tip the guide before starting the tour. They will introduce you to the scenic spots more vigorously, tell you how the camera should be graded to get a good effect, and which location will be more beautiful. Of course you can also ask him Take pictures for you.\nIt is very shady after entering the valley bottom. The Antelope Canyon is a slit canyon, formed by soft sandstone after millions of years of various erosive forces, including flash floods and wind erosion. The vertical erosive force of the flash flood formed the terrain of the Antelope Canyon and its smooth water-like edges. The magical landscape makes everyone cries of wonder from time to time.",
          "The beauty of American Antelope Canyon cannot be expressed with photos...\nCome to this land of Indians\nAs if I am already in it\nOnly when you are on the scene can you feel her beauty\nThe Antelope Canyon, one of the seven geological photography wonders in the world, is really a blockbuster for casual shooting",
          "If \"Lamb Cave\" is a late affair, then I prefer it to be the goddess of my heart forever. No man-made light, all is a feast of the light and shadow of nature. The red sandstones are refracted by natural beams of light to produce beautiful colors, such as dream silk, layers of dancing, and such as beautiful dreams, such as intoxicated. The erosion of the torrents and winds over a million years has created the most unique cave in the history of the world's geology, hidden underground, unintentionally discovered by a little girl who sheds sheep. It's not beautiful you want to see. If it encounters a torrential rain, this narrow heaven can become a rapids, never escape the possibility of hell. If it encounters a cloudy day, no sun light into, it completely loses the colorful charm. Last but not least, if you don't listen to the command and make Indian guides unhappy, let you out, out directly"

We have been snorkeling in many places around the world and the results are much better. The Ningaloo coral reef in Western Australia is far better than GBR.

The blue sky, the crystal clear lake, the white stones scattered on the shore and the swarms of albatross by the lake are just a postcard! The children also like it very much, throwing stones on the shore, interacting with water birds, and we were pleasantly surprised to find a cute bunny in the grass~ Highly recommend the friends who drive in South Island, New Zealand to check in, take pictures, sunset The church below and Lake Tekapo are really beautiful! The Church of the Good Shepherd is named after a sculpture of a shepherd dog. It is a tribute to the pioneers who created farmland and the Mackenzie area in the past. It is very memorable that they will always remember their great achievements. The church was built in 1935 by the famous architect Benjamin Woolfield Mumford, and its Gothic wood and stone structures are unique in New Zealand. Many new couples choose to hold their wedding here. From the window of the church altar, you can see the most spectacular scenery of the Southern Alps.

The lake provides the church with the lake and mountains, making it more elegant and quiet; the church is like a piece of precious jade, dotted with the lake, making it more shining. The church was built in 1935, and then named \"The Church of the Good Shepherd\" in response to the neighboring shepherd dog sculptures. It was also the place where many shepherd spirits were sued. Today, there are still many believers in the historic church. Because of its exquisite and quaint appearance and the best location to enjoy the beauty of Lake Tekapo, there are more tourists. The surrounding parking lot is hundreds of times larger than the church area. . When going to the church, the volunteer old man at the door repeatedly warned: Don't make a loud noise, don't take pictures indoors, only use the telephoto to leave your favorite photos.",

Chinese tourists came to check in during the day and watch the stars at night. The mountain view and lake view reflected next to it are actually very beautiful. The town is so comfortable that I regretted staying in a hurry and left. There is indeed a particularly magnificent starry sky here. It is very cold at night when the National Day comes. You need to be wrapped tightly before you can go out."

First, the iconic landscape is famous all over the world. The Church of the Good Shepherd and the Shepherd Dog sculpture on the south bank of Lake Tekapo are not only the iconic landscape of Lake Tekapo, but also the business card of New Zealand tourism. The dark gray and elegant churches, the dark and strong sculptures and the splendid scenery complement each other, which is unforgettable. The second is the beauty of the lakes and mountains. The sparkling milk-blue lake, the year-round snow peaks on the top of the mountain, the colorful Lubing flowers on the lake shore, and the dark gray rocky beach by the lake, are like a beautiful painting, making people like a fairyland and linger. The third is that the dreamy starry sky is desirable. The Tekapo area is the \"Dark Night Starry Sky Reserve\" named by UNESCO and is the best place to watch the stars in the southern hemisphere.

The trail starts at the Baimashan campground with a wide view. The original place was the Heights Hotel. In 1913, it was destroyed by a mountain torrent. Now there are still some ruins. In 1957, the rebuilt hotel was relocated 2 kilometers away from the plains. It looks around and is covered with shrubs and jungles. Through the \"Arhatsong Arch\", the beginning of the nine-kilometer walk of Hook Valley, the road is smooth, rugged and complex alpine meadow with woody roads, summer season, the mountains full of daisies, fluffy grass and lily like alpine hair, beautiful. The trail includes a monument to the first victims of a mountaineering accident, near the Hook Valley Trail's villa. Inscriptions show three climbers killed in an avalanche in 1914, only one body was found, but 12 years later the glacier melted. The second body was found at the bottom of Hochstetter Lcefall, 2,000 meters below where the team was buried at the time, and the glacier moved at a rapid rate. The temperature was getting lower and lower as the mountain climbed, and the gravel landslides were visible on the mountainside, and the traces of the meadow vegetation were visible, and finally the lake was near, and halfway up the mountain, there was a viewing platform, and the wooden seats were simple, and the next step was Lake Hook, and the ice-blue fault was on the cross-section of the glacier. There was a blue-sky light. There was a huge stone attraction on the trail, with a photo showing her as the first woman to make the climb to the top of Cook Mountain. After the climb, Freda left her crisp, short skirt and cane-held in front of the rock."

          "Milford Sound is to New Zealand what the Great Wall of China is to China. There is a way: you are not a hero if you do not reach the fjords. Milford Sound is located on the southwest side of the South Island of New Zealand. The distance between Queenstown and the fjord is more than 100 kilometers in a straight line. Due to the obstacle of mountains, it is necessary to detour to Te Anau. Queenstown to Te Anau, 170 kilometers, 2.5 hours by car; Te Anau to Fjord, 120 kilometers, 2 hours by car. The long and narrow Milford Sound stretches 22 kilometers inland from the coast, 2 kilometers at its widest point and 400 meters at its narrowest point. In the fjord, there are not only rugged cliffs, undulating peaks, dense rainforest, but also waterfalls, rapid waves hitting the shore, and the sea and the sky. The natural scenery of the fjord is vividly and vividly reflected, which is dizzying and beautiful. Visiting Milford Sound and taking a sightseeing cruise is the best choice. Departing from the cruise ship terminal to the estuary of the Tasman Sea, the whole journey is 32 kilometers and takes about 110 minutes. Along the way, enjoy the beautiful scenery of the bay and mountains on the deck, say hello to the seals basking in the sun beside the seal rock, and get wet with the water of the waterfall that can make you 10 years younger under the waterfall~ feel comfortable, So uncomfortable. If time is loose, some niche gameplays can be tried: take a helicopter to overlook the fjord scenery, kayak in the fjord to break the waves and hit the water, explore the secrets of the canyon along the Milford Trail~ Tips: Opposite the Milford Sound Cruise Terminal The Mitre Peak is the iconic landscape of the fjord and the business card of New Zealand tourism.

          "Wonderful experience! I am 53 years old now, but I have been so excited action this vacation in queenstown!",
          "Skydiving in Queenstown is definitely an outdoor sport that is worth coming to experience here. Everyone takes a parked plane and flies to an altitude of more than 3,000 meters in the sky, and then jumps off the plane under the leadership of a professional instructor to fly freely in the air. At the same time, a professional photographer will accompany you to take photos for you. It is really a thrilling and enjoyable high-altitude experience.",
          "[Important lessons learned]: If you have a skydiving video, please close your mouth all the way and don't let the wind enter your mouth, it will be ugly and distorted. Also, look at the camera more and interact with gestures a little more, so that it will look more vivid. If you can smile quietly, that's the best. The most important thing is to keep your mouth shut! At 8:30 in the morning, go to the store in the town to assemble and register, and then choose on the spot whether you need to pay extra for shooting. I remember that I saw on the guide before that there are 3 options for photo and video packages, and the price increases sequentially. But there are only two options when it comes to the scene. The first is the hand-held photo and video package, which costs $189. The second is the ultimate high-altitude skydiving package, $329. The first package is simply that you wear GoPro on your head and the coach also wears one on his hand. The screen shot must be a big head shot, there is no scenery, the face was deformed by the wind, and it must be ugly if it is shot at such a close distance! In the second package, in addition to the first equipment, there is another staff member who will jump with you specifically, take the panoramic view for you, and interact with you on the way. In comparison, this one will be more comprehensive and a little better. But the price difference is also relatively large. In my opinion, 99[%] of the people present basically chose package two. And there are obviously more girls parachuting than boys. The parachuting project in Queenstown is divided into three heights, 15,000 feet or 4,500 meters; 12,000 feet or 3,600 meters; and 9,000 feet or 2,700 meters. In this way, generally speaking, the total cost of skydiving is more than three thousand. Anyway, you have to prepare for at least half a day to go skydiving, because you have to drive from town to the base of the skydiving, and then the base has to return to town. You have to wait for your session in the middle, and then you have to change your clothes and train the coach briefly. Take a plane up high in the sky and then land. Finally, we have to wait for the U disk to edit the video. Quite tossing. Xiaoya didn\u2019t make a scream during the entire parachuting process. The coach was still very surprised. For fear that I fainted, he kept asking me \"are you OK?\" In fact, I just felt pain in my ears, the kind of cochlear pain. , Especially tinnitus, in short, it is very uncomfortable. But I'm not scared at all, so I am smiling hard at the camera, although smiling like crying. The moment you jump down, you have no time to hesitate, because the coach won't ask you, so he jumped. Although weightlessness is severe, you and the coach are tightly tied together, and the sense of security is still very comfortable. I think bungee jumping is more terrible than skydiving. Someone is following the skydiving, and some people are always talking in your ear. Bungee jumping is completely dependent on one's own courage, including the most terrible first step. After a rapid drop to a certain height, the instructor will open the parachute, and then the two of you will start circling slowly in the air, circle by circle, it feels very random, but the landing place is so precise. All this is controlled by the coach behind you, so please enjoy it with your heart, these rare few minutes.",
          "When you come to Queenstown, you must experience the skydiving here. Everyone jumped off the plane from an altitude of more than 3,000 meters under the leadership of the instructor. At a glance, you can see the beauty of Queenstown, the blue lakes, and the rolling snow-capped mountains. We fly above it like birds. It is really amazing and exciting.",
          "The moment I got out of the hatch, I was very nervous. The coach would not communicate with you whether you are ready. After the countdown to three, tilt your head back, let you hold the strap with both hands, and go out at once. It began to spin in the air, just like the skydiving show I've seen on TV before. It was very fun and interesting. At this time, there was no fear and fear at all, and there were various novelties."

          "I tried bungee jumping once in my lifetime, and I had to make an appointment in advance to register, and then arrived at the designated time, weighed, signed a life and death status, and went to the bridge to line up. It was very cold and windy on the bridge. I waited for a long time and it was frozen like a dog. It is recommended that people who want to go can wear more clothes. When I was in line, I didn't meet a small Chinese partner. There were more young people in Europe and the United States. I was joking and enthusiastic throughout the whole process. I was very nervous and in sharp contrast with them. Finally it was my turn, the staff immediately said a few words in Chinese, called me buyaopa, and then asked me yaobuyaoshui? I didn't react the next time, and it took a few seconds to realize that he was asking me if I should touch the water when I went down. Haha, I said no water, and my brain was blank. After all the safety measures have been taken, you will slowly move to the edge of the platform. There are photo spots where the staff will make you wave and smile, but you really can\u2019t laugh at this time. Seeing that I was rather stunned, the working guy asked me if I needed a push, and I said that I would dance by myself. At this time, I couldn\u2019t translate it in English. Don't hesitate next, as soon as you close your eyes, you jump down. The descent speed is too fast, and I bottomed out before I could yell. When I bounced, my body would involuntarily spin around wildly. This was a bit dizzy, and it was over after ten seconds. There will be a small boat stretching towards you towards the olive branch, you just need to grab it, and the two rowing brothers on the boat will chat with you. My companion helped me to record the whole video. She said why you didn't say a word... After the end, there was no discomfort. The towel on the feet was tied very well, and there was no feeling of pulling at all. One jump is more than 1,000 yuan, and there are more than 200 photos and videos. It\u2019s just that the heart before the jump will be scared. It\u2019s just like overcoming the fear and jumping. It\u2019s not scary as you imagined, so don\u2019t hesitate on the platform. The more you drag, the more you are afraid. . I have experienced bungee jumping once in my life, and it feels worthwhile.",
          "The extreme sports you must experience when you come to New Zealand! Adrenaline soaring! With the mentality of having to experience it once in my life, I gritted my teeth and jumped down hahaha. We must weigh ourselves before jumping. New Zealand beef, lamb chops and salmon are so delicious that they are five kilograms fatter than when they started. . . You can purchase pictures or videos after the jump. They are expensive, but they are also a commemorative. There will also be a T-shirt printed with a 43-meter bungee jump, and a free shuttle bus to Queenstown will be provided as a souvenir.",
          "The AJ Hackett Kawarau Bridge in Queenstown is definitely the most famous bridge here, and the clear water of the Kawarau River underneath is impressive.

          "An outdoor extreme challenge that is definitely worth going! How can you miss the ancestor of bungee jumping in Queenstown? On the day of the bungee jumping, the weather was bad and there was a light rain, the wind was strong, and it was terribly cold while waiting, so remember not to wear too little and wait on it! In the end, I jumped out and was really shocked for a moment, and then I landed freely and swayed back and forth. Finally, the crew on the boat would hand you the bamboo pole to grab and let you down. Remember to smile at the camera!",
          "When I went to the fruit town, I passed by and went in to visit. First, I went to the visitor center. It is a large building with various souvenirs for sale. Outside the building is the Kawarau River and the bungee iron bridge. The Kawarau River runs through In the canyon, the scenery is good, and the bungee jumping people jump down in the middle of the iron bridge. It seems that there are more people."

You can also walk along to the end of the gardens and follow the trails that wind along the lakefront.",

New Zealand was once a British colony, so this old garden is also full of British flavor.

          "There are many ranches in New Zealand that are particularly beautiful, and you can also see sheepdogs",
          "Steamboat + Walter Plateau Ranch half-day tour is a classic trip to Queenstown. Walter Peak, located on the opposite bank of the lake southwest of Queenstown. Walter Plateau Ranch is located on the west side of the mountain. It is one of New Zealand's oldest plateau pastures, covering an area of 68,000 hectares in its heyday. After several changes, the existing area is 25,000 hectares, and more than 40,000 Merino sheep, Romney sheep and beef cattle are stocked. Since 1991, the owner of the ranch leased 162 hectares of land by the lake to a travel agency and started a \"ranch tour\" tourism project. Therefore, many tourists feel that \"the plateau is not high and the pasture is not big\" when visiting. The ranch tour is so beautiful and beautiful. The first is to observe \"pastoralism\". The \"Sheep Shearing Show\" is lively and interesting. With the help of the shepherd's fence and the assistance of the shepherd dogs, each of the furry sheep is already bald and cute. \"Sheepdogs driving sheep\" is vivid and intuitive, with a few shepherd dogs + a group of lambs, allowing visitors to feel every bit of shepherding. \"Animal feeding\", you can have close contact with alpacas, lambs, and calves, pat and pat ~ too late. The second is to observe the \"scene\". When you go to the ranch, take a 45-minute voyage by steamboat or a 30-minute voyage by speedboat. The beautiful scenery of lakes and mountains along the way is needless to say. After arriving at the ranch, the east side of the ranch dock is the tourist area, and the west side is the villa area. The \"Colonel's House\" built in 1902 is the most eye-catching. Because of the tight time, I gave up close contact with small animals and went to the villa area to find out. The white walls are reflected by the red roof, the greenery is lined with flowers, and the scenery is extremely beautiful. In the courtyard, in front of the porch, on the greenery, among the flowers, by the benches, by the lake and beach, you can stroll around and enjoy taking pictures. The third is to taste \"food.\" During the ranch tour, you can choose to have afternoon tea or BBQ buffet. The variety of tea and meals is not rich, but the taste is authentic and delicious, coupled with the elegant environment and harmonious atmosphere, it is also a good experience.",
          "A paradise in Queenstown-Walter Peak Highland Farm\n\n\u2764\ufe0fIntroduction:\n1. The farm is located in Lake Wakatipu and is usually reached by Tss steamboat. Usually it is the itinerary of buying steam boat tickets\u2795farm cruise\u2795buffet.\n2. You can also rent a speedboat yourself, so you can control the time, but the cost will be more expensive.\n\n3. This plateau pasture does not have any altitude sickness, but it looks like a castle in a fairy tale world and is left alone. The red spire, the white city wall and the surrounding flowers are especially perfect.\n\nTips:\n1. It is recommended to wear white and solid color dresses to take pictures, because the farm has many flowers and the walls are white.\n2. Walk along the lake, sparkling, and teal, you can walk a little further, also suitable for shooting silhouettes.",
          "When you come to New Zealand, you must not miss a lively and interesting farm tour, which can fully reflect the close contact with animals and the harmony between man and nature. Alpacas are very timid and docile. The scenery is breathtaking and beautiful, very idyllic. Comfortable here, I can relax and experience the purest New Zealand farm life!",
          "Walter Cape Perk (Walter Perk) is one of the most primitive highland pastures in New Zealand. The ranch is located on the west side of the main peak of Mount Walter across Lake Queens City and is a lovely view, 45 minutes by steamboat in Queenstown to see the shearing of sheep and a buffet is very nice"

          "A small bridge flowing water home scenery, the south of the river is like this, and the books in the film and television depicted the south of the river, the most impressive is the conflict of the former residence, did not expect the literary giant from Wuzhen, open eyes!",
          "\"Walk into\" like water years, feel pillow river home\" once said Wuzhen Dongzha, my mind will immediately flash out the scene of \"like water years\". Liu Ruoying pulls the suitcase to stand in the alley, Li Xinjie sad quiet eyes, hunched up the corner of the mouth leaning in front of the door miss Huang Qi's a smile; Qi Shu is in the high patio, patching up the old yellow book newspapers ...... Wuzhen Dongzha Old Street Academy, the Linjia shop, Fengyuan Shuangqiao, dyeing cloth shop, wine shop and hotel on the edge of Mao Dun's former residence were the shooting sites of the film \"Like the Year of the Water\". The first stop of the travel destination is Wuzhen, from the Xizha settled accommodation out, first take the free shuttle bus to Dongzha. Compared to Xizha, Dongzha is much smaller, many tourists, mainly a main street. Dongzha lane street is paved with green stone, the right of the entrance is the residential, the left is Dongshihe. Here are selling local specialty, can also buy some tie dyed cloth fans. There are also lively old people in the alleys who have simply converted their homes into shops, bargained with young people, or simply shyly placed goods at the window for pick-and-roll. The most of the \"Watery Years\" is located in the east gate, the quaint residential along the river bank spread, a quaint green tile white wall, lively shops and inns on the street set, is very lively and bustling. Although the changes in Dongzha have been great for many years, some scenes in the film still remain. The scenic area completely preserves the original style and pattern of the ancient town of the water town in the late Qing and Republic of China. The building elements of the unique Jiangnan style such as the river pavilion, bridge, slate lane and Maodun's former residence are organized by the river-shaped street, the street-bridge connection, the building houses and the water town as one, which embodies the humanistic thought of the Chinese classical folk house \"making peace as beauty\" and the overall beauty of harmonious coexistence between the natural and humanistic environment. The space charm of the ancient town of Jiangnan Water Town presents. The road of the green stone plate, everywhere is a stone arch bridge. On both sides of the river, with long stone bank, feel very refreshing. Walking in the small long streets of the ancient town, slowly taste the small bridge, water, the charm of the people. This is the real old town, old houses, old streets, old shops, old workshops, a thousand-year-old river, the riverside has a few ancient trees. The old houses here are calm and cold, the corners are denudated into cultural relics, some purple purplish quietly climbed the old house brick walls. If in the old house, reading the Tang poetry and song lyrics, with the ancient sounds, I don't know what the charm. In the courtyard deep, have experienced many years of change, how many cold rain knocked the roof tile, how many awning boat rowed the quiet river. Through the wooden frames, Wuzhen was a nostalgic old man who stood, sat or sat on his knees for thousands of years, old and steady, and certainly vicissitudes and simplicity. A coarse cloth clothing wear 3000 years, a gray pants wear 3000 years, a brown quilt cover 3000 years. 3000 years not heavy makeup, 3000 years not flowering, 3000 years the same color and the true color, this is the true Wuzhen!",
          "Compared with Xizha, Dongzha is more original, retains the ancient dwellings, the life is rich. In the morning, strolling in the rain alley, the most poetic painting, feeling will meet lilac like girls. There are Mao Dun's former residence, ancient pawnshop, wood carving exhibition hall...I especially like to stand on the bridge to see the roof and rocking boat.",
          "Very characteristic of Jiangnan Water Town, the environment is beautiful and there is a sense of tranquility. The characteristic exhibition halls such as the rich coins and the contradiction residences in the town are also sold by the merchants in the town. The souvenirs with local characteristics. The shop scenery is also very poetic. You can also rent a boat to extend the water road to enjoy this other town.",
          "Wuzhen Dongzha and Xizha, by contrast, Dongzha is more lively, the fireworks are rich. If the time is rich, Dongzha Westzha is very good. Look at the former residence of Mao Dun, the former residence of Muxin, and feel the charm of literature."

It will take about a quarter of an hour to walk here. Reason for recommendation: From a distance, I saw the three characters \"Village Committee\" inlaid on the plaque, and Wu Village arrived. Wucun is an upgrade of the original natural village-Hongqiao Village. The farm houses and landforms that can be seen are all ancient and have not been dismantled, but the houses have become cleaner and the streets cleaned more neatly. To a certain extent, the original Jiangnan rural style is retained. 1. Fishing. There is no rigorous tour route in Wu Village, so you can only walk along the village committee. The closest is the fish pond. Hongqiao Village is adjacent to the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal. It has rich and delicious aquatic plants, especially fishery, which can be regarded as a major income of farmers in Jiangnan. The fish ponds here not only raise fish and shrimps, but also raise waterfowl and aquatic crops such as water chestnut according to the biological chain. The pond has a natural attraction to the northerners, not to mention the beautiful original pictures, and there can be interactive fishing here, and it is reluctant to leave. 2. Plowing. Plowing in the ground is the norm for farmers. People here are terraced fields, which are much more beautiful than simple farmland. It can even be viewed as a scenic spot. It is so beautiful. If the whole world is so sweet, why not return to nature? 3. Livestock. The second brothers, cows, sheep, chickens, ducks, big geese, and dogs are all kept here. Everyone has their own circle. They do not disturb each other but complement each other. The picture is very strong, and the smell of big dung is exceptionally comfortable~4 .idle. A large screen full of slogans, a large drying field that also plays open-air movies, a strolling village square, and an endless fruit and vegetable field, one more glance will give you more joy~tips:\u00b7Wu Village is very large and the height of the village houses is similar. , When shopping, pay attention to control the play time, watch the road signs and don\u2019t get lost. \u00b7It is still not recommended to stay too much in the livestock area, let alone feed!",

There were basically local residents on both sides of the Hundred Houses, and there were no homestays. I woke up early in the morning and saw villagers carrying two baskets of vegetables for sale. Every time I bought a few catties of embroidery. Bring home the towel. I went to the scenic spot this year and found that there have been big changes. Many scenic spots have been rehabilitated, and there are more and more activities organized by the scenic spots, such as folk performances and ethnic customs displays everywhere. What impresses me most is the local customs. The local people in Nanxun are very enthusiastic, especially the older ones. They will take the initiative to chat with you and tell you the story of old Nanxun. It is recommended to get up in the morning and go to the local noodle shop and tea house in Nanxun. Whether you know them or not, you can sit and talk together. This time I chose to live in a B&B in Baijianlou. It was very quiet at night. The lanterns on the two sides of the river were very artistic. I got up in the morning and opened the window to see the ancient buildings in Baijianlou. I booked the pass for the scenic spot online, and it was definitely worth the money after a day. 80 yuan to visit many large and small scenic spots unimpeded, every place is the imprint of the times, the collision of wealth and fashion, the combination of Chinese and Western deep house compound, magnificent decoration building, can not help but make me want to return to the four elephants. In Niu's time, let's take a look at Nanxun's once rich and enemy country. Tired of walking, I ordered a few special dishes for dinner at a small restaurant in the ancient town, about 50 per person.

Sulfur Mountain is named after the sulfur hot springs found on its slopes. You can choose the Banff Gondola (Banff Gondola) or hiking trails to climb the Sulphur Mountain. Hiking up the mountain along the rugged and winding trails is time-consuming, and it usually takes about an hour to reach the top of the mountain. Therefore, tourists usually choose to take the cable car up the mountain, and can enjoy the view of different heights as the cable car rises gradually. The cable car station is located about three kilometers south of Banff town. There are buses from Banff town. The elevation difference of the ropeway is about 680 meters. It takes about 8 minutes to reach the top of the 2,250-meter mountain. Mountain top view\nSulfur Mountain is the best place to overlook Banff Town. There is a four-story building (Upper Terminal) on the top of the mountain. Each floor has different functions, including coffee shops, souvenir shops, and the highest restaurant in Canada.

You can walk to the official viewing platform in ten minutes from the parking lot, but it\u2019s usually overcrowded here. With guardrails, you can\u2019t take pictures at all. So there is also a wild viewing platform\u2014a rock cliff with a better view. People are also more suitable for concave shapes, so we can only solve the road meal here. Let\u2019s talk about this wild viewing platform: when you look back at the official viewing platform, you can see three trails. The two on the left lead to two parking lots. Take the one on the far right, and continue to the trail on the right at a fork. About tens of meters to see the dirt road that someone stepped on on the right hand side, let's go down, follow the dirt road for a few hundred meters and you will be there. Another reminder: the weather on Lake Peto is very changeable. It was sunny just now. It might rain and snow in a blink of an eye, and the temperature is low, so be prepared."

This is the highest scenic spot in Jiuzhaigou and Haizi with the largest area. Highlights: The lake is like a mirror, the water and the sky are the same, the best time to visit and time reference: afternoon, 30 minutes. Changhai is located at the end of Zechawa Valley. The peaks next to Changhai are covered with snow all year round, surrounded by verdant forests. Standing on the Changhai viewing platform, you can see the blue sky, white clouds, and snowy peaks. You can see the mountains and the sky are connected to each other. Without distance, this is also a great sight of Changhai. Pace down the wooden plank road next to the viewing platform and come to the pool of green jade. Watching the Long Sea up close, you feel that the lake is as wide as the sea, the lake is as dark and green as jade, the green hills are towering into the clouds, and the clouds are like illusion...When visiting the Changhai, you should pay attention to a juniper cypress on the coast with a strange shape and branches and leaves on one side. The other side is as bald as a knife, and is called the one-armed old cypress. There are signs indicating that the long sea water is like a bright mirror. The ice bucket and the \"U\"-shaped valley on the opposite side are vividly vivid, with lush forests and lofty peaks. , Bathed in blue sky and white clouds, magnificent and beautiful. The long sea view is the beauty from the heart, so you can arrange more time to stop and admire it.",

There is a bend. According to the map I posted, the navigation shows that it takes nearly 4 hours. I chartered a car for one and a half hours, and the mountain road is one hour. Because the mountain road is narrow and it is cement There are many pits on the road. It is recommended to charter a car with a local driver who is familiar with mountain roads. Self-driving is very unsafe. When you arrive at the scenic spot, the fare is 100, and the scenic spot battery car is 24. In fact, it is about one kilometer in the road. It is recommended not to buy a battery ticket. I don\u2019t know if there is a peak or off-season here. Anyway, there were not many people going there on September 30, which was related to the bad walking on the mountain road. The main attractions are Shuiliandong, Jinyintan, Yaochi, Qinglonghai, Liantai Caichi, Shenwahai, beaches and ponds are karst landforms, mainly formed by calcification, Shuiliandong is actually something similar to a waterfall, the sea It is a small lake, which is beautiful when there is sun. See the photos for details. Usually the tour can end in three hours. Things to pay attention to, the first half of the journey is mountain climbing. Those with poor physical strength need to be adjusted. There is only a toilet in Shuiliandong on the way. Female friends should not drink too much water. There is no place to buy water and food in the scenic area. You need to bring your own. The scenic spot is still under development, and other scenic spots are gradually improving. At present, there are fewer tourists and it is worth visiting."

The water rushing from the Pearl Beach rolled down from the edge of the cliff, forming a wide crescent-shaped waterfall. The waterfall fell to the bottom of the valley with a deafening roar, forming a torrent of violent splashes. This torrent is all the torrents of Jiuzhaigou. The middle water color is the most beautiful, the water is the most urgent, and the water is loudest. The content of negative oxygen ions in the Pearl Beach Waterfall is extremely rich, which is hundreds of times higher than that in the plain area. It is known as the \"natural oxygen bar\".

To be strictly serious it should be a science museum b ut the idea that you are surrounded by - ahem - penises it's a little hilarious but shows just how open even modern Iceland is.I found the most interesting thing was they had models of the entire Iceland football team's 'junk'! :)",

When I passed by in the morning, I took two photos in the car, but they were a bit shaky. When I came back in the afternoon, I didn\u2019t take a car. I walked back and wanted to take two more shots. But I took photos from east to west, but the walking time was much longer than the estimated time. As a result, the road behind was almost 800 meters in sports. The speed rushed back to the dock, and almost missed the cruise. The annoying thing is that so many photos were taken along the way, but it was still not a decent sun voyager. Because I walked on the opposite side of the road, not a coastal trail. After I walked, there was no sidewalk, only the highway-like roadway.",

She led us to view the caves and explained in Mandarin. We didn't buy the tickets having English speaking guide. The site is large, looks nice, well organized for tourists, has newly built buildings to protect the remaining caves inside so it looks not authentic enough to me.

What sets this grotto apart from the other famous ones in China is the free English guides (french and german as well i think). i went in the off season and had an English guide to myself. it was very educational, and made the Mogao grottos more significant amd memorable than other grottos.",

The erosion of northwest sand caused ruins or very serious damage. The punching point is far from the entrance of the scenic spot. After entering the scenic spot, I took the scenic tour bus and really did the card- punching tour. However, the Yumenguan attraction is still more rich than Yangguan.",

Wada Meiyu from ancient times imported from the Central Plains, so it was named. The erosion of the years, the jade gate has lost the appearance of that year, now the jade gate is a mound of earth ruins."

It is strongly recommended to come. If you remember to come, choose a good time. The museum is closed on Mondays. , Don\u2019t ask why I know... If you come here by car, you can stop here, and the parking fee is 5 yuan. As a museum in the Dunhuang area, the museum mainly introduces the achievements of the area, but because of Dunhuang's position on the Silk Road, the exhibits here are very distinctive. The museum itself is not large in scale. You can visit it along the way. It is divided into several exhibition halls along the way. The exhibitions are displayed according to different eras. Among them, the hair style of the Han Dynasty is the most essential part, and there are many exhibits in each era. What is shocking is that almost all the exhibits here are originals without imitations. There are a lot of them, and most of them are not limited to shooting, which is still very impressive. The biggest feature here is the one-to-one reproduction of the Mogao Caves, which is the one introduced in the Mogao Dome movie. The shape and exquisiteness are still very beautiful. There are even restoration models of tombs at that time, and the experience is very real. There is also the only photo of Wang Taoist himself. There is a QR code on the wall of every exhibition hall here. After scanning through WeChat, there will be an audio guide for the hall. Although it is not particularly convenient, it is much better than looking at it yourself. Overall I still like this museum very much",
          "The Dunhuang Museum building is also very beautiful! The central area of the end of the pavilion is a surrounded four-way, rotating all the way down to the exit and the temporary exhibition area at the exit. This area like the Mogao Grottoes, opened a small shrine, but unfortunately there is a display in the center below, so the light is a bit bright, otherwise the lighting cast through these holes to form the shadow should be beautiful! Very friendly museum, completely free \uff5e brush ID card can enter, very good \uff5e is not very big, complete Dunhuang history of the artifacts unearthed, of course, there are scenes that are restored and duplicated, there is a restored to a tomb excavation prototype, Too easy to imagine \uff5e For grave stealing fans, it is too easy to go up \ud83d\ude48 is also a mini version of the small Mogao Grottoes \uff5e",
          "Dunhuang is quite worth to visit, worth to see several cultural places, Mogao Grottoes, West Qianfo Temple, East Qianfo, various grotto art, different ages are all different characteristics, of course, the most systematic understanding of Dunhuang or museum.",
          "Although there is no treasure in the town, it is still worth going to, and the historical evolution, customs, historical events in Dunhuang have a general understanding of the key people, the architecture is also relatively northwest."

I really think Fairy Mountain is so beautiful. It\u2019s so beautiful. No matter if it\u2019s a mobile phone or a SLR, it\u2019s beautiful. Let\u2019s summarize the questions my friends asked me. 1. Snow will always be there when it\u2019s not down. As long as the temperature on the mountain is higher than 0 degrees, it will melt, so call the scenic area before leaving. Whether there is snow before starting 2. The main road up to Fairy Mountain is very safe, there is salt, you don\u2019t need to tie an iron chain, you need to tie it to other branches 3. Actually, I don\u2019t expect to be cold, and the most easily cold is head and feet Hands, it is recommended to prepare super warm hats and gloves, rechargeable hand warmers are necessary, shoes wear waterproof, do not wear ugg snow to get all wet on the shoes, you can put a warm baby in the shoes 4. If you want to take beautiful photos I'm worried that straight men won't be able to take photos, so save more photos you like on the Internet and let him look at the photos and take them one by one, or directly ask a photographer to take a snow scene photo. 5. I didn't expect anything else for the time being. The messages I want to ask are basically all photos taken by mobile phones, just a SLR. The small video is recorded by mobile phones. Fairy Mountain is so beautiful that mobile phones can produce movies~ Miss Sister is happy to take the snow scene~"

          "There are still a lot of stairs in the ground seam scenic spot. There is no problem for young people to walk. It is a bit tired compared to the Sansheng Bridge. The two scenery are almost the same. If you have time, you can go to both places to see. If you have time, it is recommended that the Sansheng Bridge is enough.",
          "Seam this place, the environment is still very cold, the scenery is very beautiful, the depth of the buried is very deep, take the elevator nearly 100 meters, can go down or quite. It is really a great place.",

At the beginning, many people still hold their phones, either on the phone, watching videos, or talking to each other, but slowly, most people are quietly watching the performance. Applause is spontaneous, praise is spontaneous, a little touch is inadvertent. At the end of the show, many people were standing and clapping until the actors left the stage.

          "Grand Prismatic Spring is one of the most famous hot springs in Yellowstone Park. The Grand Prism is a masterpiece of Huangshi, like a business card of Huangshan's Welcome Pine. People may not have been to Huangshan, but you must have seen the image of Yingke Pine; similarly, people may not have been to Huangshi, but the panorama of the Grand Prism must have appeared on the top tourist list in the United States.\n \nThe colorful big prism, about 100 meters in diameter, is the largest hot spring in the United States and the third largest in the world. It is nearly 50 meters deep and the water temperature is as high as 85\u00b0C. 2000 liters of spring water gush out every minute. In the sky with clear rain, it seems more heated. The angle that pedestrians can see is a side plane, not the panoramic aerial view seen in major brochures.\n\nBut even if you only take a glimpse of it, you can already feel its imposing momentum. There is a feeling that you don't know the true face of Mount Lu, and you are only in it. There is another kind of scenery that is generally not easy to see at the level of a great god.\n\nDuring the full-day tour, just a few minutes of staying here, it rained. At this time, the weather, wind and rain, made people feel like being in the embrace of nature, with the clouds in the sky, wind and rain, surging in my heart. I have always believed that all the encounters during the journey are fate. Enjoy the all-round experience of the wind, rain and heat in the world, here, it is a classic!\n\nThe following paragraph is heard on the Internet: \"The beauty of the Grand Prismatic Hot Spring is that the color of the lake changes with the seasons. In spring, the lake changes from green to brilliant orange-red. This is due to the algae living in the mineral-rich water. The ratio of chlorophyll to carotenoids in their bodies changes with the seasons, and the water body shows different colors.\u201d Therefore, in the summer we arrive, the chlorophyll content here is relatively high. Low, showing orange, red, or yellow. But I heard that in winter, due to lack of light, these microorganisms will produce more chlorophyll to inhibit the color of carotenoids, so the water body appears dark green.\nCompared with the big prism, there are three small hot springs around. Although there is no big prism atmosphere, they are still delicate and beautiful.",
          "In the sun, the large patches of wrinkled ground around the big prisms give off a magical reflection. It's incredible! The colors seen from different angles are different. Everyone who comes here sees different colors at different times, different angles. In this moment, time and light may not be the best, but it is the only one. The closer you get to the Great Prism Spring, the more you can't see the full picture of it, but at close range, you can feel the heat of the steam winding in the Great Prism Spring, you can hear its gentle pulsation, it is a wonderful feeling that you can't see in the picture and you can't see it."

Yellowstone Lake in the United States of America out of the river, after a gentle hilly zone, into a length of about 38 kilometers of steep canyon, known as Yellowstone Canyon. This is one of the most magnificent and gorgeous scenery in Yellowstone Park. Here, the swift rivers splatter and form two magnificent waterfalls, roaring into the valley floor. The first waterfall is 33 meters high, this is the upper waterfall, the second is 92 meters high, called the lower waterfall. The Yellowstone Canyon is formed by the Yellowstone River erosion and geothermal erosion of volcanic rock. About 14000 to 18000 years ago, the Grand Canyon connects three times of glacier erosion, gradually forming this typical V-shaped canyon. The Yellowstone Canyon, which was only around 10,000 years ago, is quite young. One of the best spots to view Lower Falls is Uncle Tom's Trail, a branch of South Rim Trail. The end of Trail is a platform located at the waist of the canyon. From here, the waterfall is like a white cliff, with water running halfway up the valley and rainbows crossing the cliffs. It's spectacular.",

The water from the waterfall melts from the snow on the volcano and then flows into the Mississippi River.\n\nThere are 290 waterfalls above 4.6 meters in height in the park, of which the tallest is the 94-meter Yellowstone Falls. The biggest highlight of today's itinerary is to come to the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and overlook the Yellowstone Falls. If you are traveling by car, it is recommended to follow the hiking route to the foot of the waterfall and watch the waterfall close up. If you have the opportunity, you must be immersive in order to experience the natural wonders that the limited human language cannot describe and can only be breathtaking.",
          "The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is one of the famous landscapes of Yellowstone Park. You can watch the spectacular and deep canyon scenery and the waterfalls that flow down at the same time. The river water flowing out of Yellowstone Lake forms the 97-kilometer-long Yellowstone River, which is \"the only river in the United States without dams.\" The river water runs through the volcanic rocks, and the long-term strong erosion has formed the majestic Yellowstone Canyon that is 32 kilometers long, 450-1200 meters wide, and 360 meters deep. This is the most magnificent and beautiful scenery in Yellowstone Park. The long-term river scouring has formed a rock wall with magnificent colors, showing yellow, orange, brown, brown, etc. The Indians called it \"Yellow Stone\",-hence the name of the Yellow Stone. From the Yellowstone River to the Yellowstone Canyon, it fell twice in a row within a distance of less than 1 km, forming two waterfalls. The lower waterfall is 92 meters high and is the most ornamental canyon waterfall in Yellowstone Park. It is nearly twice as high as the world-famous Niagara Falls, and the upper waterfall is 33 meters high. There are viewing spots on the opposite bank of the Yellowstone River, which are: Lookout Point, Grand View and Inspiration Point. The best viewing point for the Yellowstone Grand Canyon is Inspiration Point. It should be noted that this road is a one-way street, and it is convenient to Canyon Village before leaving this section. In Upper Falls, the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone feels like an oil painting. But you can only watch the waterfall from a distance. Then we walked Uncle Tom\u2019s Trail. From the Artist Point Observation Deck, return along the original road of South Rim Drive on the South Rim Drive. There is a fork before returning to the main road. You can go to the Uncle Tom's Trail and see Lower falls up close! Although the total length is only about 2 miles, the steel structure stairs in the second half are very steep, with a total of 328 steps. It takes about 20 minutes to go down and 40 minutes to walk up. I thought I could go down to the bottom of the waterfall, but in fact it was down to half waist.

The river water flowing out of Yellowstone Lake in Yellowstone National Park in the United States flows through a section of gentle hills and then enters a steep canyon about 38 kilometers long, known as the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. This is one of the most magnificent and beautiful scenery in Yellowstone Park. Here, the turbulent river waves splashed, forming two magnificent waterfalls, roaring into the valley floor. The first waterfall is 33 meters high, this is the upper waterfall, and the second is 92 meters high, called the lower waterfall. There is also the Indian Racecourse, the sun is really too dazzling...Even if you wear sunglasses, your eyes cannot see the camera.",

          "Old Faithful Fountain is the most famous landscape in Yellowstone. The most famous geyser in Yellowstone is Old Faithful Fountain. It doesn't erupt regularly like other fountains. It erupts every few minutes and never disappoints travelers. It is always faithful and loved by the world. The old faithful fountains are sprayed every 56 minutes, each time for about 4 minutes, the highest and most beautiful time is the first 20 seconds, each time the hot water is about 10,000 gallons, the height of 40-50 meters, water temperature of 93 degrees Celsius. After winter and summer, the old faithful fountains are so in accordance with certain rules and endless spray, so that \"old faithful\" such a reputation. People come to Yellowstone Park, must see the old faithful fountains. But see it does not spray, a spray is like a thousand horses, more in the sunshine, water vapor flashes out of seven colors, grand, who can not give a sound of praise.",

The geological activity is intense, and the underground magma contains a large amount of silica, which can solidify a huge amount of explosive gas in the magma. Once the gas and magma solidify together, it will cause a large-scale eruption. Scientists estimate that in the future, a super volcanic eruption may still occur in Yellowstone Park.",
          "The Old Faithful Geyser is the most prestigious landscape in Yellowstone Park in the United States. It was the first geyser named during the Washburn-Langford-Dorn Expedition in 1870. Because it erupts regularly, the regularity of each eruption can basically be calculated. The current eruption regularity is about 90 minutes. You can search for the eruption time before entering the park and watch it in advance according to its time. Basically, it will erupt several times throughout the day, so you will never miss it. Do you know what Old Faithful Fountain was used for in the past? Everyone would never think that the old faithful fountain used to be a \"washing machine\". Because of its regular eruption, some people found that cotton and linen clothes were washed by the old faithful fountain after they were placed on the fountain. The clothes were not damaged and they were washed very clean. But clothes made of wool fabrics will be torn into pieces. But now the wonder of washing with the old faithful fountain is invisible. Since we missed the 4:30 in the afternoon, we rushed to watch the Old Faithful Fountain at 6 o\u2019clock in the evening. We encountered a small traffic jam on the way to the road because we were on the lawn on the road. There was a brown bear on the road. Everyone parked on the side of the road to watch, causing the car to move slowly. Fortunately, the driver swiftly circumvented the car and we just caught up with the time to watch. When it was exactly 18 o'clock, the crowd was already standing by the lawn. The official eruption began at 18:05. First, thick smoke and small water jets were emitted, sometimes large and small, sometimes high and sometimes short. The highest point of today's eruption reached 32 meters, although it is not the highest point in history (the highest height can reach 40-50 meters), we also felt the magnificent scene when it erupted like a galloping horse. The water temperature here is also very high, about 70-150\u2103, and some of it has been vaporized into smoke. The entire eruption lasted only about 4 minutes.",
          "The old faithful geyser of OLD FAITHFUL GERSER can be described as true loyalty. It is not like other fountains in Yellowstone Park. It has always erupted every 90 minutes or so every time for more than 100 years since it was discovered. minute. It is said that about 10,000 gallons of hot water can be sprayed each time, the height is 50 meters, and the water temperature is more than 90 degrees Celsius. The daily eruption time of the Old Faithful Fountain is announced in Old Faithful hotels, visitor centers, etc. You can confirm it before you go. This is the only attraction with benches on the viewing platform! Everyone sat in a circle and seemed to be enjoying a performance, and sincerely thanked nature for its wonderful performance. If you have time, be sure to visit the Old Faithful Inn next to it for a cup of coffee. This is the preferred accommodation recommended by LP. It was built in the 19th century and has a history of more than 140 years. It is said to be the most difficult one in the park. The eruption of the geyser can be seen from the balcony of the lobby. The hotel was built with local pine logs, no matter the beams, columns, walls, and ceilings of the building, all logs were used. The shape of the building is magnificent, the interior space is tall and open, and the hollow lobby is six or seven stories high, which is very artistic and is a rare large-scale log structure building."

Mammoths hot springs are the most active and longest-lived geothermal areas. The hot springs are very dense, resulting in a huge karst plateau, where old and new hot springs alternately undulating in years.

The continuously gushing hot springs make the landscape here continue to change. The headquarters of the Yellowstone Park Administration is also here, with the Albright Visitor Service Center open all year round. Looking at Mammoth Hot Springs from a distance, it is like a mountain covered in snow. When I approached, I realized that it was the perfect combination of Pamukkale and Huanglong. Originally, multiple hot springs flowed down from the hillside section by section, breeding a large number of bacteria, and became a colorful ladder. However, after a crustal movement in 2002, most of the hot springs ceased activity, resulting in a large number of hot springs. The death of microorganisms made Mammoth Hot Springs lose its color. You can no longer see the previous colors. If you really want to compare with Huanglong or Pamukkale, there is still a gap! The dead bacteria also turned into off-white powder, remaining on the dried up steps. Palette Spring is the most beautiful in the entire scenic spot, because it is alive, with water flowing, and it is especially white. We also saw herds of deer nearby! Elk and Moose are stupidly unclear, so let's call them \"deer\" for the time being! Ha ha. . . It is said that the grass planted around here is what the deer like most, so many deer are attracted here. The children are so happy to meet wild deer so close! Yellowstone Park is really a paradise where \"nature rules everything\"! Along the way, we met many wild animals, without cages or barbed wire. Animals here don't avoid people when they see them, and people don't hurt them, they just watch them quietly. Humans and animals coexist peacefully, depend on each other, and deeply feel all the beauty that nature has given!",

The Art Museum is only a 10-minute boat ride from Cancun. In this 15-meter deep and two-kilometer underwater art museum, you can easily find a variety of corals and tropical fish. The Museum of Art was created in 2009 by British sculptors Jason Taylor, Karen Salinas, Roberto Diaz and other Mexican sculptors.

I took a VIP Access Secret Passages: Doge's Palace and St Mark's Tour with Walks of Italy that I highly recommend which allowed me to spend extra time on the bridge, as well as see the cavernous cells where the Venetian wrongdoers were held - one of which incarcerated the infamous Casanova that managed to escape."

          "The Campanile is, perhaps, Venice's most iconic structure. It is also the tallest building in Venice and visible from almost everywhere. Visitors can take an elevator to the top (for 8 euros) and get a panoramic view over the city. The price of the lift has gone up over the years, but the view is well worth the cost. Lines move quickly, but it's worth it to get there early, as there is almost always a crowd.",

          "The view from the top on sunny days is absolutely worth the queue!",
          "It is surely the most famous monument in Venezia and one of the most famous of Italy. Together with the Basilica of San Marco and Piazza San Marco it is the very heart of Venice. It was built around IX Century and then damaged in different periods. At the beginning of 1900 it falled down and was then rebuilt."

There are a lot of hidden corners, and many of the courtyards resemble each other. As my group continued through, we found ourselves asking, \"Have we already been here?\" on more than one occasion. If possible, I'd recommend not going in the summer as there is little shade and it gets HOT. If you do go in the summer, make sure to bring plenty of sunscreen and if you get one, a mini handheld fan. There were places inside to buy water, but I'd recommend bringing your own, too.",

The wall is not a walk it is a climb. There are some very steep sections and the stairs can be a little daunting if you\u2019re afraid of heights. standing at the top of the 8th tower is something special, looking into the distance at how far it stretches and the fact that people made this huge structure is mind blowing. I feel very accomplished for climbing the wall in the conditions I faced but I\u2019m not sure I would recommend going during the same weather conditions but definitely make an effort to visit. Be sure to book online and it is much easier to get a didi to the wall as I tried getting the train to find I had no idea which train to take.",

It is the largest building group in Qing Dynasty. The residence of Yongzheng, Prince of Qing Dynasty, was sealed by the Qing Dynasty in 1851. The name of the palace of Prince Kyo was also derived. Gongwangfu is a huge building with an area of 60,000 square meters, divided into two parts: mansion and garden, with more than 30 buildings of various types, which has experienced the historical process from the peak to the fall of the Qing Dynasty, and has carried a wealth of historical and cultural information.

Compared with other palaces, either they were torn apart and turned into large courtyards, or occupied by various units, or they were in ruins. There are more than 30 building communities here, with exquisite layout and extraordinary style. Originally the mansion of Heshen, it has gone through the historical process of the Qing Dynasty from its heyday to its decline, so it is said that \"a Palace of Prince Gong, half of the history of the Qing Dynasty\".",

It is 1.5/2 hrs from Dongzhimen station and there is a direct bus that leaves in the morning (09:00). It is great to wander around the cosy village and explore all its corners and interesting attractions. The hotsprings are very beautiful and reaxing and there are so many great views in the Town. You can also visit a part of the Great Wall by night and overlook the Town. In summer there are also interesting small exhibitions and workshops. There are great food places and lots of little shops and authentic snacks. You can easily enjoy your time here for a few days and dive into the traditional culture : there are opera shows, arts and crafts shops and music.There is a pagoda, an old church, and traditional houses turned into musea. You also learn about the history or just enjoy your time with leisurely activities such as bowling, hotsprings and dining. It is a perfect getaway. We didn't organize our hostel on beforehand, we just went there and choose from the options, with hotsprings included."

          "New Zealand's Wellington Botanic Garden (WELLINGTONBOTANIC GARDEN) is located in the city center, covering an area of 25 hectares, free of tickets, and many entrances and exits. The best route is to take a cable car from LambtonQuay in the city center to the top of the mountain and enter the park on foot. Wellington Botanic Garden is very original ecology. Visiting the Botanical Garden is like walking into a natural scenic spot, with dense and tall plants such as virgin forests, low bushes, creeping plants and ubiquitous moss. The trails are guided by tile paintings. Stroll along the winding trails along the mountain road, breathe fresh air surrounded by green plants, hear the sound of birds and mountain streams, sometimes stop to look at the distant view of the city or the vast sea, and rest in the observation deck when tired. There is a botanical garden map at the entrance, which introduces several trails and marks the distance and which exit. Along the trail attractions, visitors only need to walk along the underground tile paintings, which is very convenient. The greenhouse is standard equipment for the Botanical Garden, and the indoor part of the Wellington Botanic Garden is relatively simple. Five years ago, it was the early autumn season. I saw plants growing in the air (LIVE ON AIR) for the first time there, some hanging on shelves and some climbing on other plants, very strange. The information center is called TREEHOUSE. There is a wood sculpture called BEELADY at the door. It is a work of a female artist. The material comes from a eucalyptus tree that broke in the storm in the Blue Mountains of Sydney. There is also a children\u2019s room next to it.",

This is a sacred building that was first laid in 1866, imitating the early Gothic architecture of the United Kingdom, and it was all built using New Zealand wood. This is an old church, and the figures on the stained glass are all parishioners and stories from the Bible. I was particularly curious about several flags hung in the church, including the Royal Navy flag, the US Marine Corps flag and the American flag stationed in Wellington during World War II. The staff explained that this is a flag with a story. Church, people will never forget them, God bless and bless them. This church is now mainly rented for weddings, concerts, memorials, or funerals. There is also a St. Paul's Cathedral in Wellington nearby. It is a relatively modern church we have seen and is known as the most vital church in the 21st century. There are more than 1,000 seats in total, and behind the altar is an abstract glass painting. Some windows stained glass paintings are also geometric patterns, which look modern and fashionable. The overall construction was completed in 1998. Now this church is a venue for national religious events, seminars, concerts and major events in New Zealand.",

Tickets for foreigners are a lot more expensive than natives. There is no way. Who can make us not speak Vietnamese? Even if we can speak Vietnamese, the Chinese are very different from the locals. First of all, the skin color is too pale. , Secondly, I was dressed too foreign, not to mention wearing a backpack and colorful hats. Hue is not too big, and it\u2019s not far from the hotel by taxi.

Its seven-story octagonal, 21-meter-high Fuyuan Pagoda is a symbolic building from Tianmu Temple to Hue. The name of the temple derives from the hill \"Tianmu Mountain\", but in the 19th century, in the era of Emperor Tu De, it was changed to \"Lingmao Temple\" for fear that the name would anger the sky. The temple has been expanded several times since it was built, but it was severely damaged by a typhoon in 1904, and was rebuilt several times later. The temple as a whole is a Chinese-style Buddhist temple. When you enter, you will find familiar buildings such as the bell tower, drum tower, Tianwang Hall, and Daxiong Hall. Tianmu Temple even has the monuments of gods and virtues commonly found in Chinese royal tombs, but the temple still has Vietnamese characteristics. The strangest thing is that there is an abandoned old car in the temple. It turned out to be the car used by the abbot of the temple, Shi Guangde, when he went to Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) to set himself on fire in 1953 to protest the government's suppression of Buddhism. The incident was successful that year. Arouse international attention.",

Make sure you go up where you can see the Eiffel Tower from there, and also many streets where the Arc will be right in the middle. Be ready to take the steps up, as there is no elevator. In between the sections, there will be a galleries where it shows the history of the Arc, and some stories too. ",

To get there, you can take Metro and then you can walk up, which is alot of steps, or you can also take the funicular ride up for only 2 euro. Once you are up, you can also go inside the church, which was so beautiful. I went inside when there was a mass, so alot of people joined it. If you want, you can also hike to the dome, where you will get an amazing view of Paris as well as the Eiffel tower ",

The construction of the cathedral began in 1875 and was completed in 1914.",

There are surfing spots of various difficulties and levels, such as Surfer's point, Conto, Redgate, etc. In addition to surfers, there are many families who come to Margret river. They form a group to experience the fun of camping in the wild and experience the excitement of cave exploration. Coupled with the opportunity to get close to kangaroos near Eagle's bay and Meelup beach, this is also a good place for parent-child fun.",

          "Clock in the prototype of the Spirited Away Sea Train\nBusselton Trestle, the longest maritime trestle in the southern hemisphere, would probably not be well known to the Chinese people without the romantic travel of his wife. It lies so quietly in the deep part of the Indian Ocean, watching every morning and sunset of this blue planet....The function of the old Japan has long been faded, and the trestle bridge has become a net red place. The small train slowly heading towards the depths of the ocean is known as the inspiration prototype of Spirited Away. It is no longer the truck that transported materials back then. It has become a cartoon-shaped, bright-colored, and concave-shaped prop for tourists from all over the world.\nSitting in the semi-open carriage of the small train, walking slowly along the pure white trestle bridge, the railings on both sides are infinitely laid out and seem to be retreating... At this moment, the warm sea breeze of the Indian Ocean on his face, my thoughts are light I can dance and spin, and imagine that whatever it is, it\u2019s okay.. All the drunken things that flash into my mind unconsciously, all the people who inadvertently jump in their minds, all about the sun, the sea, the sky, The cognition of wings, dreams and voyages.. Putting those wild pixels into the scene before us, and then flavoring a dose of anticipation and excitement for the unknown distance, perhaps there is also a hint of anxious pleasure.. \u2026In this way, you can complete a lonely and magical cleansing with the exhausted self in this world, filtering out the dirt and dross, compassion and self-pity, and shielding the eyes of the second person. No matter disdain or praise, you only need to take care of yourself .. is this wonderful place to give back to me the most nutritious time..",

There is also the underwater world to enjoy, and the marine life in the southern hemisphere is also very cute! Have the opportunity to appreciate it again!",

The little red train was driving on the trestle bridge, and the sea breeze passed by. Sometimes the waves hit, and it feels really magical, and it feels very different.",

The retro and cute train, with the blue sky and white clouds and the endless sea, and the cute grandpa, this picture makes people feel good and comfortable.

          "Captain Cook's heart-shaped island day trip is interesting and fun. It takes 50 minutes to reach the heart-shaped island by sailing. During the sailing process, the crew is warm and thoughtful, singing and dancing to interact with tourists, not boring at all, the crew will also make cava Entertain tourists. The heart-shaped island is very beautiful, the water is clear, and there are small sharks swimming leisurely on the shore. They are very docile and play with tourists. After getting on the island, take a glass boat to see the underwater creatures and beautiful scenery, and then take tourists to snorkel and dive. Lunch is delicious and rich, and drinks are free.",
          "In MV 2000, you can listen to live bands sing passionately, dance with friends from all over the world when it rises, and spend an unforgettable sleepless night at sea.",
          "This sunset cruise is really recommended. First, after boarding the ship, I don\u2019t think there are too many people. There are only about 20 people in total. You can sit on the outdoor deck and sail out of the port. The captain will take everyone to find the most beautiful sunset. Among the wines, there is a non-alcoholic Virgin pina colada which is my favorite. Dinner is half a lobster per person after watching the sunset. The rest is in the form of a buffet. Fish and various seafood. The overall taste is good. Finally, there is dessert What impressed me the most was that when I returned to the voyage after the meal, all the crew members taught everyone to dance, cheerful music and passionate dance steps. At that moment I really fell in love with Fiji.",

Taking pictures in the temple, even if we weren't 'clean', we went inside (my wife and daughter could later go in because they were vegetarians and there was a shower earlier in the day). We didn't understand the language of ghosts (numberless ghosts). I don't think this is for me, but it might be more interesting for other tourists.",

We could have easily spent over an hour but we speeded up the tour due to limited tour time. We were impressed with the variety of orchids, almost all of them were in bloom. The walk through the orchids was flat and laid back for all ages and in good health. The garden trail has many steps and it can be difficult to walk up. The weather was a bit overcast and particularly comfortable. We did not feel bugs when we visited here. Several glasses of ice juice were provided as we walked out which was a refreshing way to end our trip. Considering the only few dollars for the tickets, I felt great for anyone who wants to see orchids.",

The details and its size are incredible. I bought the ticket in advance and was able to walk around before my trip. I highly recommend taking this tour because there is a lot of information and history about this church. People say that the best time to visit the Sagrada Familia is during sunset... they are right.",

The entire park has lots of accents by Gaudi, but if you want to get into the museum and the highly ornate part of the park, it's only to paying customers, and even with multiple gates, there's always a line.

I drove in Berlin for the first time. After picking up the car, I didn't use the foreign language navigation on the car. I drove around the city directly, looking for traces of the TV tower, and finally drove back to the hotel. I also set off from under the TV tower several times and walked across the boulevard under the Linden Tree to the Brandenburg Gate. Therefore, what I know about Berlin is probably between the Brandenburg Gate and the TV Tower. Besides, it is impossible to comment without reaching the top. So one sunny afternoon, a person came to the tower specially. I seem to like climbing high and the feeling of overlooking a city. From this perspective, the height of all cities is worth climbing, regardless of whether the tower itself is beautiful. The same is true for the Berlin Tower. You can look at the city from a height, look at its overall colors, look for the sights you have visited, sign the distance between them, understand the layout of the city, and sometimes you can also see it from the sky. When the sun shines through the dark clouds and casts on the city, you can see through the edge of the city and feel the feeling of the sky. Lots of fun, and more. Look at the picture.",
          "The Berlin TV Tower can be regarded as the most conspicuous landmark of the city. Just like the status of the Oriental Pearl in Shanghai, it exists in Berlin. Although it is close to a pile of historical buildings on the Museum Island, its slightly elongated figure does not affect the architectural skyline of the historical and cultural area. On the contrary, near the TV tower constitutes the hub of the entire Berlin bus system. Many trams and trains can be found. The cinema mall next to the TV tower also makes this one of Germany's most important commercial centers."

          "Baihua Lane, as the name suggests, is a small alley full of flowers. It is located in the old ghetto. The streets in this area are narrow and complicated. Most of the alleys are lined with residential houses, and the outer walls of the houses are generally white. Residents decorate their own small world with flowers. Flowers of the season can be seen everywhere on the outer walls, balcony fences and tiles. It is said that every May, Cordoba will put on its most gorgeous costume and usher in the colorful \"Courtyard Festival\". Visiting tourists dig into an alley at random, and they can see Geraniums scattered on the front door and on the wall, and the flowers are as sweet and charming as a girl. During the courtyard festival, people can enter the private courtyard to visit, chat with the owner and admire the flowers, and feel the beauty of spring. The alley is really small, and you will pass by if you are not careful. When taking pictures, you can take pictures of the bell tower behind through the alleys.",
          "Baihua Alley is actually a very narrow, narrow and short path, which is really disappointing, but the small gift shops around are good for shopping. In fact, you can find a place to sit here and feel the ease of life in the small city is very happy. There are two well-known handmade leather shops in the alley, a shoe shop and a bag shop. Many people who like it will come here, but the shop is not very eye-catching."

You can enter the Mid-Levels Hot Spring for free if you live in the Hantian Hotel, and there will be a car to pick us up from the hotel to the hot spring. Go to the dressing room first. Inside, slippers, towels, shower, shampoo, shower gel, skin care products, hair dryer, etc. are all available. There are many kinds of soup ponds inside, because it is built in the middle of a mountain, and you can see Tianmu Lake while soaking. The location is excellent! It is recommended that everyone go up after entering the hot spring area, because the hot spring and the scenery above are more exciting, so you can soak in the front when you are full of energy. Lest you get tired in the second half and can't climb the mountain and miss the scenery.",

After arriving at Shouxing Square, the left of the small train is the subway. You can go to see the lions and the giant pandas. There are many bamboo culture exhibition halls. The whole journey takes 1 hour and turns back to the subway to go down the mountain. Back to the place where the train just got off, take the right cableway on Wu Yuedi one peak, is to climb the mountain to see the overall mountain view, nothing else. The down ropeway is back to Shouxing Square. We have plenty of time. There is no small train going down the mountain. We have chosen to walk. It is about half an hour to go down the mountain. The road is not difficult to walk. There are also some small attractions and shows that are not boring."

          "another nice natural experience in Takamatsu. to understand the real essence of this culture it is essential to visit this castle. what fascinated me the most is the contrast between old building and Japanese style garden and the new city with tall buildings in the background.",
          "Honmaru in Takamatsu Castle is now only a pile of stones, and the building on it has long ceased to exist. The beautiful attic in the photo is actually the Tsukimi Yag at the corner of the city wall. It faces the direction of Takamatsu Port. If foreign enemies invade from the sea, this will be the first place to get a signal. The strategic location is very important, but it is now a landmark of Takamatsu Castle.",
          "The entire Tamamo Castle is a park centered on Takamatsu Castle. In fact, the castle tower in Takamatsu Castle was demolished as early as 1884, and now only some foundation stones can be seen. From the perspective of the structure of the castle, the Honmaru of Takamatsu Castle is at the center, surrounded by a moat, connected to the outside by only a wooden sheath bridge; strategically, if the sheath bridge falls, Honmaru will be completely isolated. The turrets you can see today are Tsukimi Yagura and Water Gate, which are designated important cultural properties of Japan.",
          "Takamatsu Castle was originally erected on the north shore of Takamatsu in the four countries of Japan. It was tall and large, and was built on the pan of the Seto Inland Sea. However, it was hit by war and the wooden structures such as the castle and the castle have already existed, and the foundation of the castle is still standing here. , But it has been renamed Tamazo Park, and it has become a place for viewing autumn leaves and cherry blossoms in spring.",
          "Since ancient times, Shikoku Island has few people and poor resources, and it has not changed much. In terms of historical sites, most of the castles can be seen, but the Japanese-style castles are similar, and the jade of Himeji Castle is in front. You can only see some small features of the seaside castle. Takamatsu Castle is in Tamamo Park, and there are many tall pine trees... It is a low-lying land. When Toyotomi Hideyoshi was the younger brother of Oda Nobunaga, the last battle was here, and the water was flooded."

          "The concept of Siguo Village is similar to that of popular folk culture in China. It fully displays the rural life of a few years ago (rural love stories??). Compared with the noisy ancient towns, temples, palaces, etc., this quiet village is more capable. Relaxing travellers. At first glance, the first thing I thought of was Ninja Village... It should be because the assembly stage, huts, courtyards, suspension bridges, and kilns of Shikoku Village all created a stagnant old-time scenery.",
          "Not in the plan, but temporarily decided to go to Shikoku Village. I really think I made a very wise choice. The weather was clear that day, and Shikoku Village was particularly beautiful and peaceful. The transportation is very convenient. I live in Wacho and take the Kotohira train directly to Kotodenya Island. Walk in the indicated direction for about 5 minutes. Adult tickets are 1,000 yen. The so-called Shikoku Village is the 33 private houses that were moved here from all over the Shikoku. After being restored to their original appearance, they are distributed throughout the village, allowing you to experience the past life and the wisdom of the ancestors. If you are hungry after walking around, there is a straw house udon noodle restaurant here, and the small bowl is about 500 yen. The noodles are very strong. But don't eat too much, because there is also a very British cafe called Yiren's Restaurant. I ordered a cup of English black tea, a piece of cheesecake, and three ice cream balls. It was only 1,100 yen (72Rmb). The environment inside is very good, you can bask in the sun and have afternoon tea leisurely.",
          "Shikoku Village is a traditional folk house museum of Shikoku. It displays 33 old folk houses gathered from various prefectures and cities in the Shikoku region and Hyogo Prefecture. It is the best place to learn about the folk culture of the Shikoku region. Convenient transportation is the biggest reason why we chose this place. It is located at the foot of the Yadao scenic spot. The layout of the entire scenic spot is unique. The designer's careful planning can be seen everywhere in the village. All steps are natural stone steps, and the guardrails of bamboo paths are made of fine hemp rope. To fix. Walking into that quiet and beautiful forest, any troubles will dissipate! Going out of Shikoku Village, you can take a bus directly to the top of Yashima Mountain, which overlooks Takamatsu and various islands. Since we did not eat at noon and were too hungry, we did not go up to the mountain, but went to the Internet celebrity shop to eat chicken , I ordered all the famous meals, um...In fact, the taste of the Internet celebrity shop is really not very good!",
          "It's worth going because there are few beautiful people. After 2 hours, you can go to 8\u20e3\ufe0fLi Temple. The distance is three kilometers.",

Because the construction of the church took more than 600 years, spanning more than six centuries, during this period, the style and exquisiteness of religious works have been very good. The big change is that when you walk in the church, you can see many works of different styles, such as frescoes, reliefs, icon screens, etc., and slowly appreciate it, you can feel a very heavy sense of history.",

The dome is marked with a huge cross in the form of a glass skylight, and white glaze is used on all sides to pass through the dome from the ground. The center of the building space is a huge one tied to a golden cross.

Whist the prospect of dancing the night away in one of the city's most dangerous neighbourhoods sounds daunting, the reality is completely the opposite. Brazilians are renowned for knowing how to have a good time, and the nightlife in the favelas epitomises this, as the locals forget about their daily routines and let their hair down for a night of Favela madness! Just make sure you book it through a tour guide, rather than braving it by yourself.",

Every house here is illegal and the people here are not residents of Rio but deemed squatters.  This is not a tourist spot but the largest slum in the city and Brazil.",

The houses here are mostly old-fashioned buildings, and the sanitation is relatively poor. It is in sharp contrast with the bustling city not far away. This is the place where ordinary people in Brazil live and live. Many world-class stars walk out of these slums. It is really not easy. When you come here, you must pay attention to your own safety, especially your belongings. As the saying goes, if you do not encounter robbery and theft in Brazil, it is a miracle. Therefore, you must pay attention.",

It is very convenient to take the subway or take a taxi to the stadium. However, due to road closures during the Olympics, taxis could not enter this area after a long time.

It was opened before the World Cup on June 16, 1950. It was not until 1965 that the entire stadium was opened. Completed the construction. Unlike the platforms of other stadiums in the world, the platform of Maracan\u00e3 Stadium is located in a deep trench around the lawn, and its height is much lower than that of the turf."

I couldn't answer the question right away, but it was impossible to keep me from getting over the last time. Today I'll answer it because if I don't go to the bubble, I'll always have a thought, the best food I haven't eaten, the best things I haven't got, the most beautiful places I haven't been to, and that's human nature. So although I didn't go to the pool I knew that the pool was not a good choice, I had to go once, even if there was only one pool, I went out for a minute, I had to go, otherwise the most beautiful and best thought that I hadn't been, hadn't eaten, and hadn't played would be lost all day I'm not going to be able to feel like I'm missing out on it. But I went to the first time and spent less than 500 dollars. I broke the thought. I didn't have to torture myself through imagination. Lack of feeling, will enlarge what you do not get, will make you feel more poverty, loss, because adding the imaginary beauty of this layer, in fact you really get, will find it may be a fart, but want to get not to get, will be very painful, Feel like lost a billion. Ha ha ha, life this thing, basically I can still crack a, in fact I just spend less than 500 quail broken a thought, let oneself no lack of feeling, you say worth it? In my life, I want to experience the things basically already experienced, so I really do not have a very strong sense of lack, hunger. Can say that I even if not successful, certainly not failed, of course I personally think that can live satisfied, no regrets, is the greatest success. Hehe, life is short, don't fight with yourself, can try to satisfy yourself as much as possible, after all, can go to the world to go a difficult, don't let go of the sky, don't let go of yourself.",

Walking on the streets of the ancient town, the roads are relatively narrow, and they are all small alleys. They are similar to the ancient city of Lijiang. There are many shops that do jade and jade business. Many people still live in the ancient town. Commercial attractions without permanent residents feel completely different. Except near the gate, the entire ancient town, especially the more remote places, is still very quiet. It is also good to live in the inn inside and enjoy the days in the quiet village.",
          "On November 25, 2017, I arrived at about 1:43 pm, left around 6:25 pm, stayed for about 5 hours, basically the whole ancient town is finished, of course, many small attractions are also spent on a horse-travel, if you want to stay for a night. Heshun is an ancient town built in the Ming Dynasty. Most of the Han people in the area are descended from Sichuan, Jiangnan and Central Plains who came to Yunnan in the early Ming Dynasty to engage in military and civilian affairs. The scenery of the ancient town is still very good, and the weather that day is also good, blue sky and white clouds, the mood is very comfortable."

          "Yunnan Province is the only national wetland reserve, is a plateau volcanic silt lake ecosystem, is a good place to escape from the city bustle, seek tranquility. The scenic area is surrounded by mountains, floating on the water, a variety of flowers and seas, not clear is the grassland or lake, like a colorful giant flower blanket, beautiful magic. In autumn and winter, although the grass withered yellow, but a large flock of migratory birds migration, can see hundreds of thousands of birds flocking spectacular scene. The mid-April to May of every year is the time when orchids bloom in the North Sea, and the most beautiful season in the North Sea.",

          "Jiang Ji/Travel Notes in Tengchong The first time I heard about Tengchong was more than ten years ago. At that time, a friend of the bank recommended this place to me after a vacation. The remoteness of the place and the me at that time I don't have much interest in traveling, so I didn't even think about it. In the past two years, I like to walk around before recombining the ideal place to go. Tengchong is the place I am looking forward to. This time I will visit Yunnan for the second time even if the journey is far away. Tengchong has a variety of landscapes, including a well-known Beihai wetland, a geopark that is well planned and protected. Wetland has always been not my favorite type of scenery, because in my impression the wetland should be a swamp, bubbling, dark and dirty, and then it will be swallowed accidentally, and it will get goose bumps when I think of it. But the wetlands in Tengchong or Yunnan are different. They are more like lakes, not dirty, and have plenty of water. The main thing is that there will be beautiful thick meadows on the top. This is something I don't understand very well, it's fun and beautiful. Obviously it is dense green grass. The long and densely packed pieces form a large piece on the water surface, but it is actually movable, like a floating iceberg. People can stand on it and use a bamboo pole to row like a boat. Locally called slippery. grass. There are swans on the lake with more water and less grass. The elegant and noble cruising, the sapphire-like water surface is stirred into ripples, which is very charming. There is also a platform that extends into the lake, and you can take a nap under a parasol. It is really beautiful to taste a pot of Dianhong, and it has a moving price. Tengchong also has rich geothermal resources. There is a geothermal park called Atami, which is full of smoke as soon as you enter it, which is like a sauna. The water temperature of the hot spring is very high, the average water temperature is 80 to 90 degrees, the water quality is smooth and full, a bit like oil texture. Along the way to the rocky walls of the mountains and the lush plants, the smell of sulphur floats over from time to time. Many people soak their feet on the side of the big boiling pot, which can be regarded as experiencing folk customs, although the price is not very friendly. Of course, I have to join in the fun. I can\u2019t go to Atami and just talk about Xu Xiake. I still have to be grounded so as not to be made fun of. In this era, Xu Xiake's travel notes are uncommon, and the hot spring eggs can still have friends. There is also an ancient town in Tengchong, Heshun, which is as its name, Shihe Minshun. Heshun Ancient Town is not obtrusive, there is no strong commercial wind, more harmony and tranquility, it is a living ancient city. There is delicious food there, and there is a restaurant called Mom\u2019s Taste that has won my heart, and it tastes like home. There are also shops selling Pu'er flower cakes, coffee shops, hand-made silver ornaments, and odds and ends of daily necessities. The overall taste of life is very strong, and there is a sense that she will be there if you come or not. The ancient town also has beautiful scenery, gentle and flexible, and ancient houses. The walls are mottled leaving traces of the years. There are neatly manicured green plants and wild flowers and weeds that grow randomly. I love it without deliberately not being artificial. I also drank a kind of juice squeezed from fresh dendrobium in the ancient city, which was refreshing and refreshing. Of course there are also people, the leisurely and calm people, even if the epidemic affects business, everyone still keeps a smile, not far-fetched or flattering. Our place in Tengchong is also very comfortable"

We went to the Spring Festival, there are no tourists, almost the package. The service is also super good, there are questions and answers, and the roads are taken directly. The disadvantage is that many pools are currently being repaired. The essential oil pool in the aromatic corridor can not smell the essential oil. \u2705 tip: After the hot spring, the girl can go to the dressing room to take a snack box for 50 minutes and a salt bath for only 168.",

There is a waiter named Puyujiang who has a very good attitude and is very comfortable. Take a bath and enjoy.",

With shades of green trees, singing of insects and birds, everything is so original, and the experience is super value!",

The hotel is in Wanshige, which is very interesting. The hot spring of the hotel is a pure natural original soup. The color of the soup is gray and looks a bit dirty. The dust in Noboribetsu is relatively large because it is on the edge of the volcano. The hotel's buffet is very good, not only a variety of dishes but also a lot of seafood sashimi, all super fresh. It is a very good hotel. (This is a personal hobby, and I especially like to compare hotel food.) I stayed at night on tatami mats. The hotel has a bathroom, but the hot spring bath is also very full. The stuff inside is also very good. Another: This hotel can be bathed without accommodation. But if you can stay, I recommend accommodation. We passed in mid-October, there was no snow, but the scenery was very beautiful and not too cold. It is much better than summer. When I went there was before Halloween, the Halloween atmosphere was very strong. There are dinner and breakfast in the photo, it's really delicious, crazy recommendation."

          "There are not many scenic spots in Noboribetsu. In fact, you come to Noboribetsu more to enjoy hot spring hotels. Since you are here, you still have to come to see Jigokudani and Bear Ranch. After returning from Jigokudani to the hotel, I booked a shuttle bus to the Bear Ranch. In fact, the distance is very close, and the hot spring street is here. It was good to walk all the way back from the hot spring street when I was in the process. When you arrive at the bear farm, buy a ticket first and support WeChat payment. Remember that you can use red envelopes, so it is the most cost-effective to buy one by one person. Then take the cable car to see the raging! I actually saw a special hanging fish on the cable car. It is estimated that it was sent to the bears to eat~ The bear farm is actually not very playable. The only fun is to feed the bears to eat bear biscuits. The bears will fight for food, but also for tourists to feed themselves, some beckon and some are cute. One of their favorite bears will grab their feet and shake them like a tumbler. I don\u2019t know where I learned the posture. Really It's so cute! After watching the bear, I continued to walk forward. I felt like I was in a small village. The small houses are so cute. I guess I can sell small commodities when it gets hotter. Go to the Bear Restaurant for lunch, the taste is not bad, then go to the Bear Museum to visit, continue outdoor activities, watching the sea in the snow scene is really beautiful! There is actually an observatory. We coined a coin and looked into the distance with binoculars, and actually saw the cruise ship on the opposite side. There is also a photo spot here, where you can take pictures of the lake behind. The two Chinese couples have been here for a long time and we can only take a long view...All in all, it\u2019s worth the price. It\u2019s very original in winter. Naturally!",

A worthwhile trip! You can play in the snow in winter~\nWe stayed in Daiichi Takimoto. When we went there, the hotel\u2019s shuttle bus took us there. On the return trip, we walked back along the hot spring street. Although it is a bear farm, there are many other small animals.\nYou can take the cable car, feed the big bears, play in the snow, visit the museum...you won't be bored all afternoon to play~ It is very suitable for parents and children!\nOnce you enter the bear ranch, it is a small shop. You can take the cable car after buying the ticket next to the shop!\nOn the cable car, I also saw a cable car specially equipped with dried fish, which is probably food for the raging people.\nBuy small biscuits to feed the big bears. In order to eat the biscuits, the bears sell cute and fight fakes...\nAfter having a curry meal in the restaurant, I visited the Bear Museum.\nGoing to the end of the pasture, you will see a lot of thatched houses, as if you have come to another world, very suitable for taking pictures!\nI saw the beauty of the sea and sky along the way! Although this attraction is a bit naive compared to other sightseeing spots in Japan, and even not very playable, it is still very interesting to be able to experience different activities by jumping in the snow~\nAfter leaving the ranch, continue to take the cable car back. You can go to the store in the bear ranch and buy some souvenirs. There are many raccoons who say...\nOn the return trip, you can stroll around the hot spring street, eat snacks, and play gashapon~"

          "The scenery here is so beautiful, it is a must-visit when in Hakone. A tour of the lake is taken by ferry during which you learn the history behind the lake. The lake was formed from a previous volcanic eruption, so it's a crater lake, which is interesting. On clear days you'll see Mount Fuji and various shrines. Even if it's not clear it's still an enjoyable lake cruise.",
          "The local bus climbs up the mountain and then down to Lake Ashi. A must visit for the views of Mount Fuji set against the lake. A tori gate on the far shore adds to the beauty of the view. A park along the lakeshore allows you to get some height for added vistas but it was closed when we went.",
          "Lake Ashi is beautiful, especially when the fog is rolling in. Take a boat ride across the lake or one of the gondolas up the side of the mountain. Beautiful!"

          "Hakone Shrine has a long history and may be worse than other large shrines in terms of the scale of construction, but the scenery is far ahead of its peers... The first time you check in is Lake Torii, you will definitely notice this when you visit Lake Ashinoko in fine weather. The red color is the dense forest in the Hakone Mountains. It is said that many trees are more than 800 years old. It is refreshing to walk on the path of worship when the weather is good.",

Originally, my ancestors didn't want to go in at the door, but after I called in, they couldn't move their legs anymore. Step by step, plants, crystals, and European-style cottages are integrated, and the whole garden is shining in the sun. My daughter was five years old and had been shopping inside for a long time and she was very happy. As expected, daughters of every grade like sparkling things. If you go to Hakone, let's make arrangements to walk. There is a small garden below. You have to go down a flight of stairs. If you have enough time, you can sit in the cafe for a long time. It is definitely an Internet celebrity cafe in the mountains.",

There will be concerts on time, and the restaurant will have the right food and good food. It's worth going.",

The overall layout of the moving line has a winding path and progresses step by step. This part of our domestic art museum is still a virgin land.

It's mostly a tribute to how the sad adventurous life of the book's author, Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, led him to write one of the world's great parables.

Hakone is a very popular park in Japan. In summer or Christmas, you can see modeling lights or night-lighting installations. It is one of the few parks that are suitable for play throughout the year. In addition to fountains and flower beds, there are three botanical gardens in the park. They are: the wide \"Bougainvillea Pavilion\" with exotic flowers and plants and a southern atmosphere; the \"Tropical Plant Pavilion\" with tropical plants such as rubber and banana trees as the theme. There is also the \"Tropical Vanilla Museum\" where about 70 types of tropical herbs are gathered. There are cherry blossom trees near Qiangyuan Park, which is famous for its azaleas. In addition, in Gora Park, there are handicraft workshops where you can experience pottery and glass blowing, and there are places where you can easily experience the tea ceremony in Japan, such as the Baiyundong Tea Garden.

The water quality of more than 70% of the canned water in New Zealand is super clean, and the water temperature is maintained all year round 11 \u2103 The scenic spot is quiet and pure. It is called the \"Little Jiuzhai\" scenic trail in New Zealand for about 5 kilometers. It is the best place for hiking, oxygen inhalation, and lung washing. Personal evaluation: Although it is a \"Little Jiuzhai\", it is of course incomparable to the authentic Jiuzhaigou Ha. But it is small and exquisite. The clear and blue spring water really makes people intoxicated and without noise. It is very quiet (the genuine Jiuzhaigou is always crowded with people).

There is a big stage, great food, seats to see everyone, a great view, and the most important thing is that these best dancers perform their best. The boss here continues to absorb the best rising stars in Flamenco. If you really want to see the flamenco show, the Carmen show is the best.",
          "Flamenco originated from Arabic dance. To see flamenco, you have to go to the tavern in Seville. We did not visit the museum and bought the tickets for the performance directly, the price was 20 euros. Tickets for the day have been sold out, and you can only buy tickets for the next day. The important thing must be said three times. Be sure to grab a seat in advance. The seat is first-come-first-served, seat-grab, seat-grab, seat-grab, at least half an hour. In order to watch the sunset in Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, we could only be there 20 minutes early, and there were almost no seats left. We could only find a few seats in the last row on the side. If there is any performance that makes me want to watch a few games without wanting to go, it is undoubtedly flamenco. Every dance step of the dancer will step on the heart of the audience, and every swing of the arm is a show of strength and beauty. Watching the flamenco show up close is really exciting. For half a month in Spain, the most memorable thing is this flamenco.",

They suggested 20 minutes in advance, but on the day we watched the show, we took up a seat 45 minutes earlier and found a very good position.

Both male and female singers are outstanding. But dancing...wow! We are sitting in front, so we can clearly see the footwork. The passion of the dancers and the intensity of the dance steps are so amazing.",

I don't really like the soft dance so this is especially suitable for me and has a sense of history.

There is a beautiful ancient bridge (Dengfeng Bridge) on the Hengjiang River. There is a bridgehead hotel owner across the bridge. It is relatively real, clean and moderately priced. 3, three ways to climb the mountain: cableway (65 one way, double trip Trip.com 95, about five minutes one way), hiking road on the south side of the bridge (the highest peak of Qiyun Mountain is less than 600 meters, the attraction is halfway up the mountain, so it won't take long to climb the mountain), you can drive yourself directly to Yuehua Street Tourism Zhongba Station (There is no money for parking there, and it is a 200-meter walk into the ticket gate of the scenic spot there is Yuehua Street, so there are cars without taking the cableway to waste money) 4, Qiyun Mountain is very exquisite! Taoist attractions are scattered + exquisite scenic design + Danxia landform \uff1d65 tickets are definitely worth it. 5. Attractions are concentrated in the valley on the north side of Yuehua Street, the mountainside of Yuehua Street and the mountainside of Yuehua Street. 6, how to play? There is not enough time for most of the day, it is not bad to live in the mountain for one night, Ding Fuxian ancient homestay plus dining is good, the location is good, the room is clean, the food tastes good and the price is moderate. The boss is enthusiastic. If you live for one night, you can listen to the Taoist Watching the morning clock and the drum, and see the starry night galaxy. Scarce experience."

The main reason is that it is really good-looking, and the second is the bonus of film and television dramas. It is normal to change the abandoned warehouse to the scenic spot.

If it is daytime, or on a sunny day, such a building should be beautiful. This is one of the few remaining steam clocks in the world, with a sense of history and significance.

All of us have to wait for them to pass before letting us go on their way.\n\nThe dance hall leading to the main palace is a place where dances are performed in the palace. The \"Dance of Silence\" performed at the Kamakura Festival held in April every year is worth seeing.\n\nThe dance hall is a place where dance music and folk wedding ceremonies are held. According to legend, before the establishment of the dance hall, the beloved concubine of the tragic military commander Gen Yoshitsune Jingyuqian was the place where Gen Yoshitsune performed the dance, but the poems she danced and sang were aimed at Gen Yoshitsune.\n\nBelievers and tourists from all over the country stepped up religiously and orderly to visit the patron saint, the god of war and the god of war in the Hachiman Palace.\n \nThere were real ceremonies on that day, and people were forbidden to enter. Only by showing some kind of invitation can you enter.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcccLittle Tips:\n\nTsuruoka Hachimangu Shrine was the center of faith for the guardian deity of the samurai in the Middle Ages, and it is still the symbol of Kamakura today. Founded in 1063, the first general of the Kamakura shogun, Gen Yoshito, used to set up a division here and defeated the enemy Hei clan.\n\n\ud83c\udf1fHighlights and features:\n\n1\u20e3\ufe0fThe \"dedication\" at the entrance is very shocking (the various colorful chrysanthemums placed here are carefully cultivated by local Japanese residents at home and sent to this dedication shrine).\n\nThe Komachi Street that goes out of the palace gate leads to the east exit of Kamakura Station. On both sides of the road, there are rows of shops selling special snacks such as dumplings and pancakes, and souvenirs of Kamakura.\n\nIn the middle of the street, there is a tree-lined road one section higher than the driveway, and on both sides there are traditional stone lamps from Japanese shrines, and a large red torii gate is built at the beginning of the road. Visitors and visitors to the shrine can leisurely walk to the shrine through this straight tree-lined road. The straight path in front of the shrine is called Duan Ge.\n\n2\u20e3\ufe0fIchi no Torii is a stone Myojin Torii, made of Mikage Stone (granite) from Inujima, Bizen Country, 8.5m high and 92cm in diameter.\n\n\ud83d\udccdDetailed address:\n\nAfter walking this road, we arrived at Kamakura Station.",
          "Tsuruoka Hachimangu Shrine (\u3064\u308b\u304a\u304b\u306f\u3061\u307e\u3093\u3050\u3046) is a shrine located in Kamakura City, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. The Middle Ages is the center of faith for the guardian deity of the samurai and remains a symbol of Kamakura. It is about 10 minutes walk from Kamakura Station. Free to the outside world. The main attractions are Komachi Street (a road that runs north-south on the west side of Wakamiya Oro which extends straight from Tsuruoka Hachimangu Shrine, where there are local specialty food shops such as natto, handicraft shops such as Kamakura sculptures, and restaurants), Ichino Torii (stone Myojin Torii), Duan Ge (a high sidewalk made of earth rammed with sakura trees and azaleas planted on both sides of the road), Maiden (a place where dance music and weddings in front of the gods are held), Hongu (enshrines The main sacrifices are to the three gods Hachiman: Emperor Yingshen, God of Bimai, Empress of Shen Gong), etc. There are many people praying in the main hall, and the side hall displays several different styles of sedan chairs. There is a larger lake outside Hachimangu Shrine, where many seagulls and pigeons gather. The Hachimangu Shrine itself is not too big, and the building itself is not particularly prominent, but the natural scenery and historical sites such as the Kamakura Shogunate and Uesugi Kenshin are worth checking out for those who like history.",
          "Every year during the cherry blossom season, cherry blossoms bloom in the shrine, and a sea of pink flowers can be seen from a distance. Going further into it is a big pond with cherry blossoms on the bank and cherry blossoms in the water. There are cherry blossoms everywhere, so beautiful. It's so beautiful."

          "The fate of the Great Buddha and Kamakura, one of Japan's three great Buddhas, was often marred. The main body of the building, which was made of wood, was completed in six years. But after three years, it was destroyed by a typhoon. So, in 1253 began to recast the bronze seated Buddha statue, dedicated to the Great Buddha Hall. And the Great Buddha Hall also experienced many typhoons, fire damage, and again and again re-repair. But finally in 1498, due to the inverted water, the entire hall washed away. From then on, the Buddha statue has been open-air worship until now. Kamakura Buddha, high 11.5 meters, the interior is hollow structure, can be entered from the bottom of the Buddha statue. After entering, you can find that there are many traces of repairs inside the Buddha statue. On the left side of the statue, there are striking large grass shoes, about a meter long. I heard that children in Ibaraki Prefecture weave offerings to the Buddha. No wonder Masaoka Koki (a famous Japanese writer) writes haiku such as \"fire \u306b\u3051\u305a rain \u306b\u3082 decay \u3061\u306c Kamakura \u306e\u306f\u3060\u304b\u306f Chang hui \u304b\u3082\" (fire burns but does not destroy, rain drenches and does not decay, Kamakura open-air Buddha, perhaps eternal Buddha) to praise it.",
          "Kamakura is a famous tourist spot in Japan, and the Big Buddha is the number one attraction. The body of the Buddha is made of bronze, and the hollow can be entered for worship (the symbolic incense is about 1 yuan). The Buddha statue has a history of more than 700 years. When it was built, a palace was placed, but the building was repeatedly destroyed by natural disasters. Therefore, this big Buddha has been sitting in the open air since the Hongzhi period of the Ming Dynasty. Now it has been immortal for hundreds of years. It is said that the Buddha pole under the snow scene Beauty, it's a pity that I didn't see it.",
          "The Great Buddha of Kamakura in Japan is famous all over the world, and it is a must-see attraction in Japan. The Great Buddha of Kamakura is very big, and you can go inside to see it. Tickets are not very expensive, it is worth to see",
          "The bronze statue of the Great Buddha of Kamakura, cast in 1252\nWas originally housed in a wooden temple\nIt has been open in the open air for more than 700 years\n\nThe Big Buddha is located in the courtyard of Gaodeyuan\nThe background is breathtaking mountain forest\n\nStatue is very tall\nUp to 13 meters\n\nKamakura is 48 km from Tokyo\nIt\u2019s a short walk from the train station to the Big Buddha\n\nIt only costs a little bit\nVisitors can enter the statue~",
          "I think it\u2019s totally worth seeing. Of course, I\u2019ve heard from my friends that if I have seen the Leshan Giant Buddha or the Longmen Grottoes, the Kamakura Giant Buddha is nothing short of them. I\u2019m glad I haven\u2019t been to these two places. The Cangda Buddha is still very shocking, after all, the height of the Buddha with the pedestal is 13.35 meters. The inside of the Big Buddha is a hollow structure that can be accessed from behind."

          "Reasons for recommendation: The largest wooden Buddha statue in Japan is enshrined, and there are also Japanese-style courtyards with small bridges and flowing water in the scenic area and an excellent location with mountains and sea behind. If there is only one temple in Kamakura, I recommend Hase Temple. After passing the small bridge and flowing water, you can climb up the steps to the main hall. The eleven-faced Guanyin statue enshrined in the main hall has a high status in Japan. The hiking trail behind the main hall must not be missed. You must climb to the highest viewpoint, and you can see the beautiful scenery of the crescent-shaped Shonan coast.",

When the weather is clear, you can overlook Mount Fuji. It is also a paradise for surfers and sailing lovers.",
          "The summer on the Shonan coast is lively. People come here to escape the heat, play in the water, and surf. In winter, the coast here is not inferior. The setting sun of Mount Fuji is very clear, and the surfing warriors are still in the cold wind and icy waves. Churn",
          "The coastline is long and the waves are slightly turbulent. You can see many surfers bravely stand on the board again and again, fall off, and stand up again. Blowing the sea breeze and stepping on the waves, our gentle play is also very comfortable.",
          "Kamakura, a coastal city just an hour from Shinjuku, Tokyo, seems to have an infinite magic. It's not just a tourist attraction from all over the world, but a favorite resort for Tokyo and Yokohama. Surfing, watching the sea, watching the flowers, sardines cover rice, the fireworks convention at sea... There, everywhere with youth related things. Kamakura does not seem to be old, forever young, always let people want to love. Love Kamakura, but also thanks to the \"Sea Street Diary\" by Yuhe Zhi. It is said that Yukazu Eji made a year of intermittent shooting in Kamakura to capture the essence of the original work, and concentrated the four seasons in the 126 minutes film. Last winter, while staying in a wine house with friends, I announced my retirement plan: if I hadn't found someone at 40, I would have to use all my savings to buy a house in Kamakura and wake up every day in the sound of the waves and sleep in them. I love Kamakura not because it has the most beautiful coastline in Japan, nor because it is the fixed summer background of the Japanese opera and the sunshade, but because it is a unique smell, it is a reassuring, youth is around the smell, mixed with the salty taste of the sea, And the good smell of soap on the teenagers. Take Enoden once, look at Kamakura on the 100-year train. If you live in Tokyo, it is better to get up early and take the Odakyu line from Shinjuku Station. Take Enoden at Fujisawa Station. The intimate Japanese are prepared for the patients with \"Kamakura poisoning syndrome\". \"Odakyu Enoshima Kamakura 1 Day Tour Ticket\", can be round-trip to Shinjuku and Fujisawa, and can be boarded and dropped at Enoshima unlimited times. You can buy it at Shinjuku Station, lazy people must. Enoshima has a history of 100 years, the line is close to the South Shonan coast, from Fujisawa City through Enoshima to Kamakura, and the route 15 stations. Four stations parallel to the coastline, and about half the railway lines can see the sea directly. When the slow-moving trams pass through residential areas, another rail, and caves, a blue sea is introduced to the eye at the next corner. Put down the camera, and try to engrave the pictures you see into your mind. This moment, it is worth tears. Go to the heart, do a lonely foodie Jiangzhi electric sit to Long Valley Station, go to the seaside direction about 10 minutes, you can find this invincible sea view of the mind. After a long morning, you are hungry? So why don't you settle down for lunch here? It's the restaurant where Yasumi Nagazawa and Kentaro Higuchi date in the Sea Street Diary. The owner said that since the movie was released, there have been many pilgrimage fans, and I like the restaurant very much. But the boss didn't make it a selling point. His words were: \"The guest eats all the food, is to me the best reward.\" And then I scratched my head embarrassedly, this hair longer than I have a swarthy black man, so looked more adorable. I ordered the curry-and-rice package with chilled peach wine, the soft-boiled curry was melted, the grocery was made with unnamed beans, the crisp bites, and the baked eggplant was delicious, and the onion soup was delicious with creamy aroma. So if you happen to be in Kamakura, be sure to have a meal and enjoy this mundane moment. Go to the blissful temple, also don't forget to see the purple flower friend hear I am in Kamakura, told me to replace her to go to the blissful temple station, because her favorite Japanese drama \"the penultimate love\" the hero every day will go to work in blissful temple to take the electric. If you like watching Japanese dramas and shadows as much as I do, you'll love this tiny station. The name of the station comes from a temple called the temple, less than 100 meters from the station. When I went to the temple, the purple flowers were not all in full bloom, only a few. The trees in the temple grew very well, the sun through the dense branches and leaves scattered down the floor, forming a beautiful spot, I seemed to approach the mist forest, the wind blowing through the leaves of the \"crypton\" sound clearly heard, as if in the ear. Later I went to Kamakura, and friends on the way to the moonyard, also saw the blooming purple Yang flower, purple Yang flower is not hated the rain season only thought. Going to the seaside, Kamakura has the most beautiful coastline in Japan. Here I saw the golden sunset. The coastline is very clean and the ecological environment is good. There are also many places to sit and watch the sunset, steps and so on. Can you find a place better for love than here? I don't think so."

The carriages of several carriages are of different colors, quite cute, and the driving route is also very magical.

If you only look at those promotion photos, it seems well plan and constructed. I visited all the parks myself, I feel its badly craft and looks plastic. Maintainence also a main concern. Distance of each theme park is quite a distance. Unless you have your own private car or you have to wait for park transportation for which operate rarely. I strongly suggest not no to visit if you should expect the same like Disneyland. You may have another option by visit the beach nearby but its always crowded during Summer season. ",
